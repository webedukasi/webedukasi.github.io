The first mistake is already corrected. Find and correct nine more. and give reasons.Why Sports? by Jamal Jefferson A lot of people are criticizing school sports these days. Some say there's too much while emphasis on football and basketball, if there's not enough emphasis on education. Others say the idea of the scholar-athlete is a joke. Still others say sports provide a way of encouraging violence. I think they're all wrong. If anything, school sports help prevent violence, not encourage it. Why do I think sports are a positive force? For one thing, sports are positive even though they give students opportunities to be involved in something. Every day on TV we hear that violence is increasing. I think a lot of people get involved in crime when they won't have enough to do to keep themselves busy. After you'll play two or three hours of basketball, baseball, or any other kind of sport, It's hard to commit a violent act even you want to. Second, sports teach people a lot of worthwhile things, especially at the high school level. If they play on a team, students learn to get along and work with others. Wherever their team wins, they learn how to be good winners; when their team will lose, they find out they have to struggle to improve. They discover that winning a few and losing a few are part of the normal ups and downs of life. Also, there's no doubt that students improve their physical condition by participating in sports. Finally, sports are positive although they allow students who do not have enough money to go to college to get sports scholarships and improve their chances for a successful life. Whereas a young basketball player from a small village in Nigeria can get a scholarship to play for say, UCLA, he will have a chance to get an education and probably make his life better. Wherever a young woman with little money is accepted on the University of Toronto swim team and gets a scholarship, she'll have the chance to earn a college degree and go on to a high-paying job. Because school sports programs have some deficiencies that need to be corrected, their benefits outweigh their disadvantages. I should know because I'm one of those students.

Some say there's too much while emphasis on football and basketball, if there's not enough emphasis on education. Others say the idea of the scholar-athlete is a joke. Still others say sports provide a way of encouraging violence. I think they're all wrong. If anything, school sports help prevent violence, not encourage it. Why do I think sports are a positive force? For one thing, sports are positive even though they give students opportunities to be involved in something. Every day on TV we hear that violence is increasing. I think a lot of people get involved in crime when they won't have enough to do to keep themselves busy. After you'll play two or three hours of basketball, baseball, or any other kind of sport, It's hard to commit a violent act even you want to. Second, sports teach people a lot of worthwhile things, especially at the high school level. If they play on a team, students learn to get along and work with others. Wherever their team wins, they learn how to be good winners; when their team will lose, they find out they have to struggle to improve. They discover that winning a few and losing a few are part of the normal ups and downs of life. Also, there's no doubt that students improve their physical condition by participating in sports. Finally, sports are positive although they allow students who do not have enough money to go to college to get sports scholarships and improve their chances for a successful life. Whereas a young basketball player from a small village in Nigeria can get a scholarship to play for say, UCLA, he will have a chance to get an education and probably make his life better. Wherever a young woman with little money is accepted on the University of Toronto swim team and gets a scholarship, she'll have the chance to earn a college degree and go on to a high-paying job. Because school sports programs have some deficiencies that need to be corrected, their benefits outweigh their disadvantages. I should know because I'm one of those students. School sports must stay. help please:)​</a>

Ki Hajar Dewantara Raden Mas Soewardi Soerjaningrat also known as Ki Hajar Dewantara is a pioneer of education for native Indonesians in Dutch colonial times. Soewardi was born on May 2, 1889 in Yogyakarta. He was from noble family. Thanks to his family's background, he was able to access the colonial public education. He graduated from ELS. Then he continued his study at STOVIA, a medical school for native students. However, he failed to graduate because of illness. Later Soewardi worked as a journalist and wrote for many newspapers. During his career in printed media, he was considered as a talented writer. His writing was popular, communicative, and yet imbued with idealism for freedom and anti-colonialism sentiment. Soewardi was also active in social and political organizations He joined Budi Utomo in 1908. Later he was invited to join the Indische Partij established by Douwes Dekker in 1912. In 1913, Soewardi wrote several critical columns. His article was considered criticizing the colonial government of Netherlands Indies. As a consequence, Soewardi was exiled to the Netherlands. During his exile. Soewardi was active in the Indonesia student's organization, Indische Vereeniging in this organization, Soewardi got an idea to improve the quality of natives by studying education. Finally he got the European certificate, a diploma in education. He was also fascinated by the ideas of Western education figures. Their thoughts contributed to Soewardi's idea for veloping t own educational system: In September 1919, Soewardi returned to Java. Then he joined his brother in establishing a school in his hometown. After getting teaching experiences, he founded the Nationaal Onderwijs Instituut Ampel. However, during the colonial social discrimination, education was only made possible for the elites, the colonial Dutch people, and Javanese noblemen families. Education was not made for the native commoners. In July 3, 1922, he established Taman Siswa. This school provided education for the native population When Soewardi was 40, he chose "Ki Hadjar Dewantara" as his new name. He also scrapped the title "Raden Mas" in front of his name. He intended to freely interact with people of all social backgrounds and to be close to them. Ki Hajar Dewantara died in Yogyakarta on April 26, 1959. In recognition for dedication in pioneering public education in Indonesia, he was declared as the Father of National Education, and his birthday is appointed as the National Education Day. Answer the following questions based on the text above! 1. Why did Soewardi not finish his study in STOVIA? 2. How was Soewardi's career in printed media? 3. Why was Soewardi exiled to Netherlands? 4. Why did Soewardi establish Taman Siswa? 5 Why did Soewardi change his name and omit his Javanese gentility title?​</a>

                                            The researchers have developed new insulation materials to make old buildings more energy
efficient, in term of their facades, wall cavities, and interiors. Karim Ghazi Wakili, a physicist with EMPA
Research Institute, showed Euro News three prototypes. The first is insulation material made mainly out
of three layers of polyester fibers. It has two textiles on both sides. The third material is the cheapest
one. It is made out of a material called ‘perlite’. It is thicker because perlite has higher thermal
conductivity.
Gabriele Masera, a building engineer at Politecnico di Miano University states that the
researchers have tested these material in a building of the Politecnico di Milano University in Italy. It
was built in 1965. The inner walls of one room were covered with sensors and fitted with the three
prototype of insulation materials. The sensors measure temperature, humidity and heat flow at three
different places: outside the building- that is why we have sensors installed on the façade-in cavity walls,
and finally on the inner surface of the walls.
Outside sensors also measure radiation and wind speed. This way we are able to see how much
heat leaks from the different materials in building. All the data help us build a mathematical model that
will allow us to understand how each material reacts to different climatic conditions.
Magnetti building in Milan, which makes re-fabricated kits for retrofitting exterior facades, is the
kind of company the research aims at. Insulation materials developed by the researchers will be
included in some of its kits, which can be customized.
Director of Operation Marco Predo believes the market is ready for such solution, provided they
come at a competitive price. In recent years, we have seen data that seems to prove that the market for
retrofitting facades and existing buildings is indeed on the rise. So, we are quite optimistic indeed about
the market prospect for these new insulation material.
The researchers hope their new insulation solutions could become an affordable market reality
in around four or five years.

                                            The Era of ReformIt seems that in this era of reform, everybody is free to do what they want and what they like. Individuals and groups can hold demonstration at will. One can freely lodge a protest, slander one another, or force someone into a corner, including the President, Vice President, and ministers. They seem to ignore the values of the Pancasila State Philosophy, one principle of which is respect for humanity.The demonstrations have not only been held by university students, but:, unfortunately, by the elite political members who sit in the House of Representatives and people’s Consultative assembly. They also tend to resort to demonstrations.In efforts to find solutions to a number of national calamities and issue- such as earthquakes, fires, and floods- elite groups should not rush to put the blame on the other side, even on the President and Vice President, but they should make a concerted effort to shoulder the responsibility.Concerning the frequent visits to foreign countries made by the President, we should view them as working visits with the important purpose of telling the world that Indonesia is still a sovereign country, supported by the people and with a legitimate government. In fact, the visits have resulted in the return of confidence of many foreign countries, which are ready to extend relief aid to disaster-stricken areas.On our part, I would like to suggest that it would be much more dignified for the legislators to raise funds through legitimate means and from whatever source, or to contribute a fraction of their salaries (say Rp 1 million each), and send the money to Bengkulu to alleviate the suffering of the earthquake.Please stop making people confused by criticizing the performance of the President and Vice President, blaming them for being incapable national lenders.We are still concerned about the current security and order that need sorting out. This might have resulted from too many negative comments made by the political elite, which makes the people wonder what is really happening in this country.Realizing the fact above, we, as good citizens, should think how to resurrect from some difficulties the country has, rather than to criticize and to blame others. Let’s think what we should present for our beloved country not what we should gain from the 1countryWhat do the political elite members tend to do relating to the national issues and disaster?AThey do what they want to do in parliamentBThey rush to put the blame on the other side even on the PresidentCThey criticize the incapable of good citizensDThey ignore the suffering of the other elite politics membersEThey feel confident to solve the problem​</a>

Find and correct nine more. and give reasons.Why Sports? by Jamal Jefferson A lot of people are criticizing school sports these days. Some say there's too much while emphasis on football and basketball, if there's not enough emphasis on education. Others say the idea of the scholar-athlete is a joke. Still others say sports provide a way of encouraging violence. I think they're all wrong. If anything, school sports help prevent violence, not encourage it. Why do I think sports are a positive force? For one thing, sports are positive even though they give students opportunities to be involved in something. Every day on TV we hear that violence is increasing. I think a lot of people get involved in crime when they won't have enough to do to keep themselves busy. After you'll play two or three hours of basketball, baseball, or any other kind of sport, It's hard to commit a violent act even you want to. Second, sports teach people a lot of worthwhile things, especially at the high school level. If they play on a team, students learn to get along and work with others. Wherever their team wins, they learn how to be good winners; when their team will lose, they find out they have to struggle to improve. They discover that winning a few and losing a few are part of the normal ups and downs of life. Also, there's no doubt that students improve their physical condition by participating in sports. Finally, sports are positive although they allow students who do not have enough money to go to college to get sports scholarships and improve their chances for a successful life. Whereas a young basketball player from a small village in Nigeria can get a scholarship to play for say, UCLA, he will have a chance to get an education and probably make his life better. Wherever a young woman with little money is accepted on the University of Toronto swim team and gets a scholarship, she'll have the chance to earn a college degree and go on to a high-paying job. Because school sports programs have some deficiencies that need to be corrected, their benefits outweigh their disadvantages. I should know because I'm one of those students. School sports must stay. help please:)​</h2><br />

Some say there's too much while emphasis on football and basketball, if there's not enough emphasis on education. Others say the idea of the scholar-athlete is a joke. Still others say sports provide a way of encouraging violence. I think they're all wrong. If anything, school sports help prevent violence, not encourage it. Why do I think sports are a positive force? For one thing, sports are positive even though they give students opportunities to be involved in something. Every day on TV we hear that violence is increasing. I think a lot of people get involved in crime when they won't have enough to do to keep themselves busy. After you'll play two or three hours of basketball, baseball, or any other kind of sport, It's hard to commit a violent act even you want to. Second, sports teach people a lot of worthwhile things, especially at the high school level. If they play on a team, students learn to get along and work with others. Wherever their team wins, they learn how to be good winners; when their team will lose, they find out they have to struggle to improve. They discover that winning a few and losing a few are part of the normal ups and downs of life. Also, there's no doubt that students improve their physical condition by participating in sports. Finally, sports are positive although they allow students who do not have enough money to go to college to get sports scholarships and improve their chances for a successful life. Whereas a young basketball player from a small village in Nigeria can get a scholarship to play for say, UCLA, he will have a chance to get an education and probably make his life better. Wherever a young woman with little money is accepted on the University of Toronto swim team and gets a scholarship, she'll have the chance to earn a college degree and go on to a high-paying job. Because school sports programs have some deficiencies that need to be corrected, their benefits outweigh their disadvantages. I should know because I'm one of those students. School sports must stay. help please:)​</h2><br />

                            15. Read the following text carefully! Ki Hajar Dewantara Raden Mas Soewardi Soerjaningrat also known as Ki Hajar Dewantara is a pioneer of education for native Indonesians in Dutch colonial times. Soewardi was born on May 2, 1889 in Yogyakarta. He was from noble family. Thanks to his family's background, he was able to access the colonial public education. He graduated from ELS. Then he continued his study at STOVIA, a medical school for native students. However, he failed to graduate because of illness. Later Soewardi worked as a journalist and wrote for many newspapers. During his career in printed media, he was considered as a talented writer. His writing was popular, communicative, and yet imbued with idealism for freedom and anti-colonialism sentiment. Soewardi was also active in social and political organizations He joined Budi Utomo in 1908. Later he was invited to join the Indische Partij established by Douwes Dekker in 1912. In 1913, Soewardi wrote several critical columns. His article was considered criticizing the colonial government of Netherlands Indies. As a consequence, Soewardi was exiled to the Netherlands. During his exile. Soewardi was active in the Indonesia student's organization, Indische Vereeniging in this organization, Soewardi got an idea to improve the quality of natives by studying education. Finally he got the European certificate, a diploma in education. He was also fascinated by the ideas of Western education figures. Their thoughts contributed to Soewardi's idea for veloping t own educational system: In September 1919, Soewardi returned to Java. Then he joined his brother in establishing a school in his hometown. After getting teaching experiences, he founded the Nationaal Onderwijs Instituut Ampel. However, during the colonial social discrimination, education was only made possible for the elites, the colonial Dutch people, and Javanese noblemen families. Education was not made for the native commoners. In July 3, 1922, he established Taman Siswa. This school provided education for the native population When Soewardi was 40, he chose "Ki Hadjar Dewantara" as his new name. He also scrapped the title "Raden Mas" in front of his name. He intended to freely interact with people of all social backgrounds and to be close to them. Ki Hajar Dewantara died in Yogyakarta on April 26, 1959. In recognition for dedication in pioneering public education in Indonesia, he was declared as the Father of National Education, and his birthday is appointed as the National Education Day. Answer the following questions based on the text above! 1. Why did Soewardi not finish his study in STOVIA? 2. How was Soewardi's career in printed media? 3. Why was Soewardi exiled to Netherlands? 4. Why did Soewardi establish Taman Siswa? 5 Why did Soewardi change his name and omit his Javanese gentility title?​</h2><br />

                            21. The researchers have developed new insulation materials to make old buildings more energy
efficient, in term of their facades, wall cavities, and interiors. Karim Ghazi Wakili, a physicist with EMPA
Research Institute, showed Euro News three prototypes. The first is insulation material made mainly out
of three layers of polyester fibers. It has two textiles on both sides. The third material is the cheapest
one. It is made out of a material called ‘perlite’. It is thicker because perlite has higher thermal
conductivity.
Gabriele Masera, a building engineer at Politecnico di Miano University states that the
researchers have tested these material in a building of the Politecnico di Milano University in Italy. It
was built in 1965. The inner walls of one room were covered with sensors and fitted with the three
prototype of insulation materials. The sensors measure temperature, humidity and heat flow at three
different places: outside the building- that is why we have sensors installed on the façade-in cavity walls,
and finally on the inner surface of the walls.
Outside sensors also measure radiation and wind speed. This way we are able to see how much
heat leaks from the different materials in building. All the data help us build a mathematical model that
will allow us to understand how each material reacts to different climatic conditions.
Magnetti building in Milan, which makes re-fabricated kits for retrofitting exterior facades, is the
kind of company the research aims at. Insulation materials developed by the researchers will be
included in some of its kits, which can be customized.
Director of Operation Marco Predo believes the market is ready for such solution, provided they
come at a competitive price. In recent years, we have seen data that seems to prove that the market for
retrofitting facades and existing buildings is indeed on the rise. So, we are quite optimistic indeed about
the market prospect for these new insulation material.
The researchers hope their new insulation solutions could become an affordable market reality
in around four or five years.

                            25. The Era of ReformIt seems that in this era of reform, everybody is free to do what they want and what they like. Individuals and groups can hold demonstration at will. One can freely lodge a protest, slander one another, or force someone into a corner, including the President, Vice President, and ministers. They seem to ignore the values of the Pancasila State Philosophy, one principle of which is respect for humanity.The demonstrations have not only been held by university students, but:, unfortunately, by the elite political members who sit in the House of Representatives and people’s Consultative assembly. They also tend to resort to demonstrations.In efforts to find solutions to a number of national calamities and issue- such as earthquakes, fires, and floods- elite groups should not rush to put the blame on the other side, even on the President and Vice President, but they should make a concerted effort to shoulder the responsibility.Concerning the frequent visits to foreign countries made by the President, we should view them as working visits with the important purpose of telling the world that Indonesia is still a sovereign country, supported by the people and with a legitimate government. In fact, the visits have resulted in the return of confidence of many foreign countries, which are ready to extend relief aid to disaster-stricken areas.On our part, I would like to suggest that it would be much more dignified for the legislators to raise funds through legitimate means and from whatever source, or to contribute a fraction of their salaries (say Rp 1 million each), and send the money to Bengkulu to alleviate the suffering of the earthquake.Please stop making people confused by criticizing the performance of the President and Vice President, blaming them for being incapable national lenders.We are still concerned about the current security and order that need sorting out. This might have resulted from too many negative comments made by the political elite, which makes the people wonder what is really happening in this country.Realizing the fact above, we, as good citizens, should think how to resurrect from some difficulties the country has, rather than to criticize and to blame others. Let’s think what we should present for our beloved country not what we should gain from the 1countryWhat do the political elite members tend to do relating to the national issues and disaster?AThey do what they want to do in parliamentBThey rush to put the blame on the other side even on the PresidentCThey criticize the incapable of good citizensDThey ignore the suffering of the other elite politics membersEThey feel confident to solve the problem​</h2><br />
