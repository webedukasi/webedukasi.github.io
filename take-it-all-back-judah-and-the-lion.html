                                            Long time ago a rabbit and a lion were neighbors. The lion was very proud, and was fond of boasting about his strength. And the lion though that they were such close neighbors, the lion looked down upon the rabbit, and used to bully and frighten her. Finally, the rabbit could stand it no longer and wanted to get her own back.
One day, she went to the lion and said, "Good day, respected elder brother. Imagine it, I met an animal over there who looked exactly like you, and he said to me, "Is there anyone in the world who dares stand up to me? If there is, let him come and have a duel with me. If there is no one, all of you have to submit of my rule and be my servants!" "Oh, he was an can't even light on anyone!", added the rabbit.
"Oho," the lion said, "Didn't you mention me to him?" 
"Yes, indeed," the rabbit replied, "but it would have been better if I hadn't. When I described how strong you were, he just sneere and said dreadfully rude things. He even went so far as to say that wouldn't take you for his attendant!".
The lion flew into a rage and roared, "Where is her? Where is her?" 
So the rabbit took the lion behind a hill and not going too near herself. Pointed to a deep well from a distance, and said, "He is down there, in the well". 
The lion hastened to the well and glared angrily into it. Yes, there was his rival who even glared back at him angrily. The lion roared, and his enemy roared back. The lion became so furious that his hair stood on end. So did his enemy's in the well. The lion showed his teeth and lashed out with his paws to scare his rival and his enemy in the well retaliated! In a fit it anger the lion sprang into the air run all his might and then flung himself at the enemy in the well.
The result was that the proud lion was instantly drowned.

Long time ago a rabbit and a lion were neighbors. The lion was very proud, and was fond of boasting about his strenght. And though they were such close neighbors, the lion looked down upon the rabbit, and used to bully and frighten her. Finally, the rabbit could stand it no longer and wanted to get her own back.
   One day, she went to the lion and said"Good day"
   Respected elder brother. Imagine it, I met an animal over there who looked exactly like you, and he said to me, "Is there anyone in the world who dares stand up to me? If there is, let him come and have a duel with me. If there is no one, all of you have to submit to my rule and be my servants!"
"Oh, he was an can't even light on anyone" added the rabbit.
   "Oho" the lion said, "Didn't you metion me to him?"
   "Yes, indeed" the rabbit replied, "But it would have been better if I hadn't. When I described how strong you were, he just sneere and said dreadfully rude things. He even went so far as to say that wouldn't take you for his attendant!"
    The lion flew into a rage and roared, "Where is her? Where is her?"
   So the rabbit took the lion behind a hill and not going too near herself. Pointed to a deep well from a distance and said, "He is down there, in the will"
    The lion hastened to the well and glared angrily into it. Yes, there was his rival who even glared back at him angrily. The lion roared and his enemy roared back. The lion became so furious that his hair stood on end. So did his enemy's in the well. The lion showed his teeth and lashed out with his paws to scare his rival - and his enemy in the well retaliated! In a fit of anger the lion sprang into the air with all his might and then flung himself at the enemy in the well.
The result was that the proud lion was instantly drowned.

Life was good for Rattlesnake and Lizard, except Mountain Lion was always teasing them.One day Rattlesnake, Lizard and the other animals had enough of Mountain Lion.They thought it was a good idea to build a canyon because Mountain Lion didn't like to climb(even if he was a Mountain Lion).They also thought it would be good to have a river in the bottom, because Mountain Lion didn't like to go in the water either.So finally, they got everybody together and started to build the canyon.They dug a tunnel so the water could come from the lake that they found.They called it the Grand Canyon, because it is a canyon and they called it Grand, because it kept Mountain Lion away.And that is how the Grand Canyon was formed and named.</a>

The next day when the lion met the donkey, he asked him about it The donkey replied, "Oh! I don't like attending parties. There is no place like home. So I stayed home and relaxed." The donkey had told the truth but in an insulting way. In anger the lion banished the donkey from the jungle.

                                            Long, long time ago a rabbit and a lion were neighbours. The lion was very proud, and was fond of boasting about his strength. And though they were such close neighbours, the lion looked down upon the rabbit, and used to bully and frighten her. Finally, the rabbit could stand it no longer and wanted to get her own back.
One day she went to the lion and said, “Good day, respected elder brother. Imagine it, I met an animal over there who looked exactly like you, and he said to me, ‘Is there anyone in the world who dares stand up to me/ if there is, let him come and have a duel with me. If there is no one, all of you have to submit to my rule and be my servants!” “Oh, he was an intolerable braggart! He is so puffed up with pride that his eyes can’t even light on anyone!” added the rabbit.
“Oho,” the lion said. “Didn’t you mention me to him?”
“Yes, indeed,” the rabbit replied. “but it would have been better if I hadn’t. When I described how strong you were, he just sneered and said dreadfully rude things. He even went so far as to say that he wouldn’t take you for his attendant!”
The lion flew into a rage and roared, “Where is he? Where is he?”
So the rabbit took the lion behind a hill and, not going too near herself, pointed to a deep well from a distance, and said, “He is down there, in the well.”
The lion hastened to the well and glared angrily into it. Yes there as his rival who even glared back at him angrily. The lion roared, and his enemy roared back. The lion became so furious that his hair stood on end. So did his enemy’s in the well. The lion showed his teeth and lashed out with his paws to scare his rival and his enemy in the well retaliated! In a fit of anger the lion sprang into the air with all his might and then flung himself at the enemy in the well. The result was that the proud lion was instantly drowned.

If there is no one, all of you have to submit of my rule and be my servants!" "Oh, he was an can't even light on anyone!", added the rabbit.
"Oho," the lion said, "Didn't you mention me to him?" 
"Yes, indeed," the rabbit replied, "but it would have been better if I hadn't. When I described how strong you were, he just sneere and said dreadfully rude things. He even went so far as to say that wouldn't take you for his attendant!".
The lion flew into a rage and roared, "Where is her? Where is her?"

                            29. Long, long time ago a rabbit and a lion were neighbours. The lion was very proud, and was fond of boasting about his strength. And though they were such close neighbours, the lion looked down upon the rabbit, and used to bully and frighten her. Finally, the rabbit could stand it no longer and wanted to get her own back.
One day she went to the lion and said, “Good day, respected elder brother. Imagine it, I met an animal over there who looked exactly like you, and he said to me, ‘Is there anyone in the world who dares stand up to me/ if there is, let him come and have a duel with me. If there is no one, all of you have to submit to my rule and be my servants!” “Oh, he was an intolerable braggart! He is so puffed up with pride that his eyes can’t even light on anyone!” added the rabbit.
“Oho,” the lion said. “Didn’t you mention me to him?”
“Yes, indeed,” the rabbit replied. “but it would have been better if I hadn’t. When I described how strong you were, he just sneered and said dreadfully rude things. He even went so far as to say that he wouldn’t take you for his attendant!”
The lion flew into a rage and roared, “Where is he? Where is he?”
So the rabbit took the lion behind a hill and, not going too near herself, pointed to a deep well from a distance, and said, “He is down there, in the well.”
The lion hastened to the well and glared angrily into it. Yes there as his rival who even glared back at him angrily. The lion roared, and his enemy roared back. The lion became so furious that his hair stood on end. So did his enemy’s in the well. The lion showed his teeth and lashed out with his paws to scare his rival and his enemy in the well retaliated! In a fit of anger the lion sprang into the air with all his might and then flung himself at the enemy in the well. The result was that the proud lion was instantly drowned.

                            37. The Rabbit Revenge

And thought they were such close neighbors, the lion look down upon the rabbit, and use to bully and frighten her. Finally, the rabbit could stand it no longer and wanted to get her own back.
One day she went to the lion and said," Good day, respected elder brother. Image it, I met an animal over there who looked exactly like you, and he said to me, ‘Is there anyone in the world who dares stand up to me? If there is, let me come and have a duel with me. If there is no one, all of you have to submit to my rule and be my servants!" "Oh, he was an intolerable braggart! He is so puffed up with pride that his eyes can't even light on anymore!" added the rabbit.
"Oho," the lion said. "Didn't you mention me to him?"
"Yes, indeed, "the rabbit replied. "But it would have been better if I hadn't. When I described how strong you were, he just sneered and said dreadfully rude things. He even went so far as to say that he wouldn't take you for his attendant!"
The lion flew into a rage and roared, "Where is he? Where is he?"
Soon the rabbit took the lion a hill and, not going to near herself, pointed to a well from a distance, and said,"He is down there, in the well."
The lion hastened to the well and glared angrily into it. Yes there was his rival who even glared back at him angrily. The lion roared, and his enemy roared back. The lion become so furious that his hair stood on end. So did his enemy on the well. The lion show his teeth and lashed out with his paws to scare his rival and his enemy in the well retaliated! In a fit of anger the lion sprang into the air with all his might and then flung himself at the enemy in the well. The result was that the proud lion was instantly drowned

                        The Lion And The Mouse<br />Once when a Lion was asleep, a little Mouse began running up and down upon him. This soon wakened the Lion, who placed his huge paw upon him and opened his big jaws to swallow him.<br />"Pardon, O King!" cried the little Mouse, "Forgive me this time. I shall never repeat it and I shall never forget your kindness. And who knows, but I may be able to do you a good turn one of these days?"<br />The Lion was so tickled at the idea of the Mouse being able to help him, that he lifted up his paw and let him go.<br />Sometime later a few hunters captured the King and tied him to a tree while they went in search of a wagon to carry him on.<br />Just then the little Mouse happened to pass by, and seeing the sad plight in which the Lion was, ran up to him and soon gnawed away the ropes that bound the King of the Beasts. "Was I not right?" said the little Mouse, very happy to help the lion.<br />
