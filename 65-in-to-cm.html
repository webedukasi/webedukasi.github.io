Also called great pandas, parti-colored bears, bamboo bears and white bears, giant pandas are distinguished from other pandas by their large size and black-and-white coloring. The bold coloring may provide camouflage, according to the Smithsonian National Zoo.  
Giant pandas live up to their name. They are 4 to 5 feet (1.2 to 1.5 meters) tall and weigh up to 300 lbs. (136 kilograms), according to the National Geographic, about the same as an American black bear. By comparison, their distant relatives, red pandas, are only 20 to 26 inches (50 to 65 cm) tall and weigh 12 to 20 lbs. (5.4 to 9 kg).
Habitat
In the wild, giant pandas are only found in the remote, mountainous regions of central China, in Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, according to the National Zoo. In this area, there are cool, wet bamboo forests that are perfect for the giant panda's needs. Giant pandas make their dens from hollowed-out logs or stumps of conifer trees found within the forest. 
Diet
A giant panda's appetite for bamboo is insatiable. They eat bamboo 12 hours a day. That adds up to 28 lbs. (12.5 kg) of bamboo each day, according to National Geographic. But one reason they eat so much is that bamboo is low in nutrients, according to the San Diego Zoo. Giant pandas also eat rodents, fish, insects and birds. Eating both vegetation and meat makes these pandas omnivores. 
The giant panda's stomach is ideal for digesting bamboo. The walls of the stomach are extra-muscular to digest the wood of the bamboo. The stomach is also covered inside with mucus that prevents it from being punctured by splinters. 
Habits 
Giant pandas are loners. They dislike being around other pandas so much that they have a heightened sense of smell that lets them know when another panda is nearby so it can be avoided, according to the National Geographic. If another giant panda does get close, the two will end up swatting and growling at each other. Sometimes they will even bite each other. 
On average, a giant panda's territory is about 1.9 square miles (5 square kilometers). To mark their territory, giant pandas secrete a waxy scent marker that they rub on their territory. Other giant pandas can tell the sex, age, reproductive condition, social status and more from the scent marker, according to the San Diego Zoo.
The only time that these pandas seek each other out is during mating season. Males will use their smelling ability to find a female when they are ready to mate

                                            Bacalah teks berita di bawah ini dengan teliti! Carilah kalimat penting nya. Uniknya Jogja Bay Pirates Adventure, Waterpark Terbesar Terlengkap dan Tercanggih di Indonesia Satu lagi objek wisata yang siap menarik perhatian pengunjung diresmikan di Yogyakarta. Objek wisata terbaru di Yogyakarta ini ini dinamakan Jogja Bay yang merupakan waterpark terbesar, terlengkap, dan tercanggih di Indonesia. Jogja Bay diluncurkan Gubernur DIY Sri Sultan HB, Minggu (20/12/2015). Jogja Bay yang terletak di Desa Maguwoharjo Depok Sleman ini termasuk sangat unik tidak jauh dari Stadion Maguwoharjo Sleman. Wahana permainan air terluas di Indonesia pantas disematkan kepada Jogja Bay. Hal tersebut dikarenakan waterpark ini berada pada areal seluas 7,7 hektare yang menggunakan lahan milik Tanah Kas Desa (TKD) Maguwoharjo. Wahana terlengkap juga berusaha dicapai oleh Jogja Bay dengan memiliki 19 jenis wahana dengan keunggulan 'How to survive in tsunamy and earthquake'. "Di sini tidak sebatas wisata air saja, tetapi ada wahana edukasinya," ungkap CEO PT Taman Wisata Jogja (TWJ) Bambang Soeroso. "Ada delapan ombak besar termasuk ombak tsunami. Nanti disertai penyelamatan diri untuk setiap ombak sehingga warga tahu bagaimana cara menghadapinya," ungkapnya. Tema Bajak Laut (Adventure Pirates) menjadi andalan Jogja Bay. Tema ini sengaja dipilih untuk menjadikan Jogja Bay setara dengan waterpark lainnya semisal water bom yang ada di Bali dan waterpark di Orlando. Memadukan unsur Jogja dan Eropa juga menjadi salah satu keunikan dari Jogja Bay. Setting lokasi Jogja Bay menceritakan tentang perkampungan tua bajak laut yang bernuansa tropical lust. Salah satu unggulannya adalah area bermain anak-anak yang sangat luas serta keunggulan kolam rapid river yang sebelumnya belum ada di Indonesia. Pihak pengelola menyediakan tempat parkir yang mampu menampung 400 mobil, 30 bus, dan 1.000 kendaraan roda dua. Tak hanya itu, pengelola juga menyediakan shuttle bus dari kompleks parkir yang akan membawa pengunjung ke depan pintu masuk. Jogja Bay mematok harga tiket anak-anak kurang dari 2 tahun free. Adapun untuk anak-anak yang tingginya kurang dari 110 cm biaya tiketnya Rp. 60.000, dewasa Rp. 90.000, dan orang tua di atas 65 tahun Rp. 60.000. Jogja Bay buka setiap hari dari pukul 09.00 hingga 18.00 WIB. Adapun untuk hari libur, waterpark buka lebih cepat, yaitu 08.00 WIB.​</a>

          Tyrannosaurus Rex, sometimes just called T-rex, is believed to be the largest and most fearsome predator on Earth’s land ever to  have existed. This dinosaur once roamed the Earth in the Crestaceaous period approximately 68 to 65 million years ago.
          As a carnivorous dinosaur, this giant predator most likely ambushed its preys, and devoured them with jaws full of sharp teeth. With its ability to run at an astonishing speed 0f 32 mph (50 km per hour), a perfect slim and stiff tail that gave it an excellent balance and allowed it to make quick turns, equipped this gigantic predator and made it even more deadly, like a killing machine.

                       Despite its name, a green sea turtle’s shell is not always green. The shell can be a blend of different colours including brown, dark olive, grey or black. The shell is also smooth and heart-shaped. Green sea turtles actually received their colourful name from the colour of their subdermal (underneath the skin) body fat.
                        Green sea turtles are really big. They can grow to 91-122 cm in length. They are very dense and heavy animals. Despite their size, they are still not the world’s largest sea turtles.
                          Adult green sea turtles are herbivores. The jaw is serrated to help the turtle easily chew their primary food source – sea grasses and algae. Meanwhile, juvenile green sea turtles are omnivores. They eat a wide variety of plant and animal life, including insects, crustaceans, sea grasses and worms.
                           Green sea turtles have ocean water habitats and nesting habitats. Once a green sea turtle hatches and heads into the oceans, it rarely returns to land. Instead, it feeds on off-shore plant blooms around islands and beaches.

                            7. Giant pandas are bears that are native to China, where they are considered a national treasure. Even with this exalted status, giant pandas are endangered: only about 1,600 live in the wild, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). About 100 live in zoos around the world.
Size &amp; description
Also called great pandas, parti-colored bears, bamboo bears and white bears, giant pandas are distinguished from other pandas by their large size and black-and-white coloring. The bold coloring may provide camouflage, according to the Smithsonian National Zoo.  
Giant pandas live up to their name. They are 4 to 5 feet (1.2 to 1.5 meters) tall and weigh up to 300 lbs. (136 kilograms), according to the National Geographic, about the same as an American black bear. By comparison, their distant relatives, red pandas, are only 20 to 26 inches (50 to 65 cm) tall and weigh 12 to 20 lbs. (5.4 to 9 kg).
Habitat
In the wild, giant pandas are only found in the remote, mountainous regions of central China, in Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, according to the National Zoo. In this area, there are cool, wet bamboo forests that are perfect for the giant panda's needs. Giant pandas make their dens from hollowed-out logs or stumps of conifer trees found within the forest. 
Diet
A giant panda's appetite for bamboo is insatiable. They eat bamboo 12 hours a day. That adds up to 28 lbs. (12.5 kg) of bamboo each day, according to National Geographic. But one reason they eat so much is that bamboo is low in nutrients, according to the San Diego Zoo. Giant pandas also eat rodents, fish, insects and birds. Eating both vegetation and meat makes these pandas omnivores. 
The giant panda's stomach is ideal for digesting bamboo. The walls of the stomach are extra-muscular to digest the wood of the bamboo. The stomach is also covered inside with mucus that prevents it from being punctured by splinters. 
Habits 
Giant pandas are loners. They dislike being around other pandas so much that they have a heightened sense of smell that lets them know when another panda is nearby so it can be avoided, according to the National Geographic. If another giant panda does get close, the two will end up swatting and growling at each other. Sometimes they will even bite each other. 
On average, a giant panda's territory is about 1.9 square miles (5 square kilometers). To mark their territory, giant pandas secrete a waxy scent marker that they rub on their territory. Other giant pandas can tell the sex, age, reproductive condition, social status and more from the scent marker, according to the San Diego Zoo.
The only time that these pandas seek each other out is during mating season. Males will use their smelling ability to find a female when they are ready to mate

                            12. Bacalah teks berita di bawah ini dengan teliti! Carilah kalimat penting nya. Uniknya Jogja Bay Pirates Adventure, Waterpark Terbesar Terlengkap dan Tercanggih di Indonesia Satu lagi objek wisata yang siap menarik perhatian pengunjung diresmikan di Yogyakarta. Objek wisata terbaru di Yogyakarta ini ini dinamakan Jogja Bay yang merupakan waterpark terbesar, terlengkap, dan tercanggih di Indonesia. Jogja Bay diluncurkan Gubernur DIY Sri Sultan HB, Minggu (20/12/2015). Jogja Bay yang terletak di Desa Maguwoharjo Depok Sleman ini termasuk sangat unik tidak jauh dari Stadion Maguwoharjo Sleman. Wahana permainan air terluas di Indonesia pantas disematkan kepada Jogja Bay. Hal tersebut dikarenakan waterpark ini berada pada areal seluas 7,7 hektare yang menggunakan lahan milik Tanah Kas Desa (TKD) Maguwoharjo. Wahana terlengkap juga berusaha dicapai oleh Jogja Bay dengan memiliki 19 jenis wahana dengan keunggulan 'How to survive in tsunamy and earthquake'. "Di sini tidak sebatas wisata air saja, tetapi ada wahana edukasinya," ungkap CEO PT Taman Wisata Jogja (TWJ) Bambang Soeroso. "Ada delapan ombak besar termasuk ombak tsunami. Nanti disertai penyelamatan diri untuk setiap ombak sehingga warga tahu bagaimana cara menghadapinya," ungkapnya. Tema Bajak Laut (Adventure Pirates) menjadi andalan Jogja Bay. Tema ini sengaja dipilih untuk menjadikan Jogja Bay setara dengan waterpark lainnya semisal water bom yang ada di Bali dan waterpark di Orlando. Memadukan unsur Jogja dan Eropa juga menjadi salah satu keunikan dari Jogja Bay. Setting lokasi Jogja Bay menceritakan tentang perkampungan tua bajak laut yang bernuansa tropical lust. Salah satu unggulannya adalah area bermain anak-anak yang sangat luas serta keunggulan kolam rapid river yang sebelumnya belum ada di Indonesia. Pihak pengelola menyediakan tempat parkir yang mampu menampung 400 mobil, 30 bus, dan 1.000 kendaraan roda dua. Tak hanya itu, pengelola juga menyediakan shuttle bus dari kompleks parkir yang akan membawa pengunjung ke depan pintu masuk. Jogja Bay mematok harga tiket anak-anak kurang dari 2 tahun free. Adapun untuk anak-anak yang tingginya kurang dari 110 cm biaya tiketnya Rp. 60.000, dewasa Rp. 90.000, dan orang tua di atas 65 tahun Rp. 60.000. Jogja Bay buka setiap hari dari pukul 09.00 hingga 18.00 WIB. Adapun untuk hari libur, waterpark buka lebih cepat, yaitu 08.00 WIB.​</h2><br />

                            23. Tyrannosaurus Rex
          Tyrannosaurus Rex, sometimes just called T-rex, is believed to be the largest and most fearsome predator on Earth’s land ever to  have existed. This dinosaur once roamed the Earth in the Crestaceaous period approximately 68 to 65 million years ago.
          As a carnivorous dinosaur, this giant predator most likely ambushed its preys, and devoured them with jaws full of sharp teeth. With its ability to run at an astonishing speed 0f 32 mph (50 km per hour), a perfect slim and stiff tail that gave it an excellent balance and allowed it to make quick turns, equipped this gigantic predator and made it even more deadly, like a killing machine.

                       Green sea turtles are rarely seen on land.They are endangered species with a drastically reduced population.
                       Despite its name, a green sea turtle’s shell is not always green. The shell can be a blend of different colours including brown, dark olive, grey or black. The shell is also smooth and heart-shaped. Green sea turtles actually received their colourful name from the colour of their subdermal (underneath the skin) body fat.
                        Green sea turtles are really big. They can grow to 91-122 cm in length. They are very dense and heavy animals. Despite their size, they are still not the world’s largest sea turtles.
                          Adult green sea turtles are herbivores. The jaw is serrated to help the turtle easily chew their primary food source – sea grasses and algae. Meanwhile, juvenile green sea turtles are omnivores. They eat a wide variety of plant and animal life, including insects, crustaceans, sea grasses and worms.
                           Green sea turtles have ocean water habitats and nesting habitats. Once a green sea turtle hatches and heads into the oceans, it rarely returns to land. Instead, it feeds on off-shore plant blooms around islands and beaches.
