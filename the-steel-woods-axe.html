                                            THE HONEST WOODCUTTER
In a village next to a forest there lived two woodcutters. They were neighbors staying next to each other. Deena, the first woodcutter is a very energetic and honest one. Soma the other woodcutter was a lazy and mean person. Both earn there living by cutting woods in the near by forest. One day as usual in the morning, Deena started his work. Soma: Ah! He has started early in the morning. Boring! I will start a bit later. Soma led a miserable life as he was not ready to work hard. Deena went to the forest and looked out for woods. Deena: Here I don't find any good wood. Let me go to the riverside where I will get wood. So Deena walked towards the river. There he found a big tree. Deena climbed up the tree and started to chop the wood. As he was chopping the axe slipped from his hand and fell into the river. Deena: Oh no. What have I done? That was my only property which earned money. Without that what will I do? Oh God Please help me. He started crying and prayed to God. God answered his prayer. God appeared and asked him. God: Why are you crying my son? Deena: Mother, I dropped my axe in the river. Please help me. God: Don't worry I will get you the axe. God took an axe from the river. It glittered as it was made of gold. Deena was stunned to see such a shining beautiful axe. But Deena said without any hesitation. Deena : No mother this is not mine God again took another axe from the river. It was made of silver. God: My Son is this your axe? Deena : No God now pulled an axe made of iron. God: Is this yours? Deena face showed the sign of joy. Deena: Yes mother this axe is mine. God: My son. I am very much pleased with your honesty. Take all the three axes. This is a reward for your honesty. It's all yours. Deena happily went to his home with the three axes. When he crossed Soma's house Soma saw the axes and was stunned. Soma: He went with the iron axe in the morning but now he is returning back with a golden and silver axe. Something has happened. Let me follow him and find out. Soma without the knowledge of Deena followed him. Deena reached the house and called his wife. Deena: My dear wife, where are you. Come on fast. I could not wait any long. Wife: I am coming... what's the matter? Deena: Come and see for yourself. Wife: Any thing special. She came there and saw the axes. She was surprised. Wife: How.. How come you got this gold and silver axe? Deena explained how the God appeared and gave him the axes. Wife: I find no words to speak. Deena: We will sell the golden axe in the market. Soma who was hearing all this from outside decided to follow Deena the next day. The next day Deena sold the golden axe and started a new happy life. Even though he has become rich, Deena went to work as usual. Soma: Deena where are you going in this early hour. Deena: As usual to work. Soma: Ok see you... (to himself) he is really a fool. Having become rich still he goes to work instead of enjoying his life. Oh.. Let me follow him to find out where he chops his woods. Soma followed Deena to the forest. Deena went near the river and started his work. Soma: Ah!... this is the river where his axe slipped. Let me wait till he leaves this place. Soma waited till Deena left. Soma immediately went to the river. And deliberately dropped his axe in to the river. Soma: Oh God, please help me to get back my axe. God appeared. God: Why are you crying my son? Soma: Mother my axe fell into the river. Please help me. God: This guy is playing with me. Let me teach him a lesson. God took out his iron axe first. God: Is this your axe? Soma: What Deena told his wife is that God showed the golden axe first? But now she is showing my iron axe. No problem. Let me tell the answer. Soma: No God then took out silver axe and showed it to him God: Is this your axe? Soma: No...no... not this one God took out the golden axe God: Is this your axe? Soma: Yes yes yes.. this one is mine. God was furious now. God: How dare you? Telling lies to me? You should be punished for telling lies. Saying this God disappeared with the axe. Soma: My axe... my axe. God Please forgive me for telling lies. Please give back my iron axe. Oh God... What will I do now? All his shouting went useless. Soma returned home without the axe which was his only property. But he had learnt his lesson.

THE HONEST WOODCUTTER
In a village next to a forest there lived two woodcutters. They were neighbors staying next to each other. Deena, the first woodcutter is a very energetic and honest one. Soma the other woodcutter was a lazy and mean person. Both earn there living by cutting woods in the near by forest. One day as usual in the morning, Deena started his work. Soma: Ah! He has started early in the morning. Boring! I will start a bit later. Soma led a miserable life as he was not ready to work hard. Deena went to the forest and looked out for woods. Deena: Here I don't find any good wood. Let me go to the riverside where I will get wood. So Deena walked towards the river. There he found a big tree. Deena climbed up the tree and started to chop the wood. As he was chopping the axe slipped from his hand and fell into the river. Deena: Oh no. What have I done? That was my only property which earned money. Without that what will I do? Oh God Please help me. He started crying and prayed to God. God answered his prayer. God appeared and asked him. God: Why are you crying my son? Deena: Mother, I dropped my axe in the river. Please help me. God: Don't worry I will get you the axe. God took an axe from the river. It glittered as it was made of gold. Deena was stunned to see such a shining beautiful axe. But Deena said without any hesitation. Deena : No mother this is not mine God again took another axe from the river. It was made of silver. God: My Son is this your axe? Deena : No God now pulled an axe made of iron. God: Is this yours? Deena face showed the sign of joy. Deena: Yes mother this axe is mine. God: My son. I am very much pleased with your honesty. Take all the three axes. This is a reward for your honesty. It's all yours. Deena happily went to his home with the three axes. When he crossed Soma's house Soma saw the axes and was stunned. Soma: He went with the iron axe in the morning but now he is returning back with a golden and silver axe. Something has happened. Let me follow him and find out. Soma without the knowledge of Deena followed him. Deena reached the house and called his wife. Deena: My dear wife, where are you. Come on fast. I could not wait any long. Wife: I am coming... what's the matter? Deena: Come and see for yourself. Wife: Any thing special. She came there and saw the axes. She was surprised. Wife: How.. How come you got this gold and silver axe? Deena explained how the God appeared and gave him the axes. Wife: I find no words to speak. Deena: We will sell the golden axe in the market. Soma who was hearing all this from outside decided to follow Deena the next day. The next day Deena sold the golden axe and started a new happy life. Even though he has become rich, Deena went to work as usual. Soma: Deena where are you going in this early hour. Deena: As usual to work. Soma: Ok see you... (to himself) he is really a fool. Having become rich still he goes to work instead of enjoying his life. Oh.. Let me follow him to find out where he chops his woods. Soma followed Deena to the forest. Deena went near the river and started his work. Soma: Ah!... this is the river where his axe slipped. Let me wait till he leaves this place. Soma waited till Deena left. Soma immediately went to the river. And deliberately dropped his axe in to the river. Soma: Oh God, please help me to get back my axe. God appeared. God: Why are you crying my son? Soma: Mother my axe fell into the river. Please help me. God: This guy is playing with me. Let me teach him a lesson. God took out his iron axe first. God: Is this your axe? Soma: What Deena told his wife is that God showed the golden axe first? But now she is showing my iron axe. No problem. Let me tell the answer. Soma: No God then took out silver axe and showed it to him God: Is this your axe? Soma: No...no... not this one God took out the golden axe God: Is this your axe? Soma: Yes yes yes.. this one is mine. God was furious now. God: How dare you? Telling lies to me? You should be punished for telling lies. Saying this God disappeared with the axe. Soma: My axe... my axe. God Please forgive me for telling lies. Please give back my iron axe. Oh God... What will I do now? All his shouting went useless. Soma returned home without the axe which was his only property. But he had learnt his lesson.</a>

                            9. THE HONEST WOODCUTTER
In a village next to a forest there lived two woodcutters. They were neighbors staying next to each other. Deena, the first woodcutter is a very energetic and honest one. Soma the other woodcutter was a lazy and mean person. Both earn there living by cutting woods in the near by forest. One day as usual in the morning, Deena started his work. Soma: Ah! He has started early in the morning. Boring! I will start a bit later. Soma led a miserable life as he was not ready to work hard. Deena went to the forest and looked out for woods. Deena: Here I don't find any good wood. Let me go to the riverside where I will get wood. So Deena walked towards the river. There he found a big tree. Deena climbed up the tree and started to chop the wood. As he was chopping the axe slipped from his hand and fell into the river. Deena: Oh no. What have I done? That was my only property which earned money. Without that what will I do? Oh God Please help me. He started crying and prayed to God. God answered his prayer. God appeared and asked him. God: Why are you crying my son? Deena: Mother, I dropped my axe in the river. Please help me. God: Don't worry I will get you the axe. God took an axe from the river. It glittered as it was made of gold. Deena was stunned to see such a shining beautiful axe. But Deena said without any hesitation. Deena : No mother this is not mine God again took another axe from the river. It was made of silver. God: My Son is this your axe? Deena : No God now pulled an axe made of iron. God: Is this yours? Deena face showed the sign of joy. Deena: Yes mother this axe is mine. God: My son. I am very much pleased with your honesty. Take all the three axes. This is a reward for your honesty. It's all yours. Deena happily went to his home with the three axes. When he crossed Soma's house Soma saw the axes and was stunned. Soma: He went with the iron axe in the morning but now he is returning back with a golden and silver axe. Something has happened. Let me follow him and find out. Soma without the knowledge of Deena followed him. Deena reached the house and called his wife. Deena: My dear wife, where are you. Come on fast. I could not wait any long. Wife: I am coming... what's the matter? Deena: Come and see for yourself. Wife: Any thing special. She came there and saw the axes. She was surprised. Wife: How.. How come you got this gold and silver axe? Deena explained how the God appeared and gave him the axes. Wife: I find no words to speak. Deena: We will sell the golden axe in the market. Soma who was hearing all this from outside decided to follow Deena the next day. The next day Deena sold the golden axe and started a new happy life. Even though he has become rich, Deena went to work as usual. Soma: Deena where are you going in this early hour. Deena: As usual to work. Soma: Ok see you... (to himself) he is really a fool. Having become rich still he goes to work instead of enjoying his life. Oh.. Let me follow him to find out where he chops his woods. Soma followed Deena to the forest. Deena went near the river and started his work. Soma: Ah!... this is the river where his axe slipped. Let me wait till he leaves this place. Soma waited till Deena left. Soma immediately went to the river. And deliberately dropped his axe in to the river. Soma: Oh God, please help me to get back my axe. God appeared. God: Why are you crying my son? Soma: Mother my axe fell into the river. Please help me. God: This guy is playing with me. Let me teach him a lesson. God took out his iron axe first. God: Is this your axe? Soma: What Deena told his wife is that God showed the golden axe first? But now she is showing my iron axe. No problem. Let me tell the answer. Soma: No God then took out silver axe and showed it to him God: Is this your axe? Soma: No...no... not this one God took out the golden axe God: Is this your axe? Soma: Yes yes yes.. this one is mine. God was furious now. God: How dare you? Telling lies to me? You should be punished for telling lies. Saying this God disappeared with the axe. Soma: My axe... my axe. God Please forgive me for telling lies. Please give back my iron axe. Oh God... What will I do now? All his shouting went useless. Soma returned home without the axe which was his only property. But he had learnt his lesson.

THE HONEST WOODCUTTER
In a village next to a forest there lived two woodcutters. They were neighbors staying next to each other. Deena, the first woodcutter is a very energetic and honest one. Soma the other woodcutter was a lazy and mean person. Both earn there living by cutting woods in the near by forest. One day as usual in the morning, Deena started his work. Soma: Ah! He has started early in the morning. Boring! I will start a bit later. Soma led a miserable life as he was not ready to work hard. Deena went to the forest and looked out for woods. Deena: Here I don't find any good wood. Let me go to the riverside where I will get wood. So Deena walked towards the river. There he found a big tree. Deena climbed up the tree and started to chop the wood. As he was chopping the axe slipped from his hand and fell into the river. Deena: Oh no. What have I done? That was my only property which earned money. Without that what will I do? Oh God Please help me. He started crying and prayed to God. God answered his prayer. God appeared and asked him. God: Why are you crying my son? Deena: Mother, I dropped my axe in the river. Please help me. God: Don't worry I will get you the axe. God took an axe from the river. It glittered as it was made of gold. Deena was stunned to see such a shining beautiful axe. But Deena said without any hesitation. Deena : No mother this is not mine God again took another axe from the river. It was made of silver. God: My Son is this your axe? Deena : No God now pulled an axe made of iron. God: Is this yours? Deena face showed the sign of joy. Deena: Yes mother this axe is mine. God: My son. I am very much pleased with your honesty. Take all the three axes. This is a reward for your honesty. It's all yours. Deena happily went to his home with the three axes. When he crossed Soma's house Soma saw the axes and was stunned. Soma: He went with the iron axe in the morning but now he is returning back with a golden and silver axe. Something has happened. Let me follow him and find out. Soma without the knowledge of Deena followed him. Deena reached the house and called his wife. Deena: My dear wife, where are you. Come on fast. I could not wait any long. Wife: I am coming... what's the matter? Deena: Come and see for yourself. Wife: Any thing special. She came there and saw the axes. She was surprised. Wife: How.. How come you got this gold and silver axe? Deena explained how the God appeared and gave him the axes. Wife: I find no words to speak. Deena: We will sell the golden axe in the market. Soma who was hearing all this from outside decided to follow Deena the next day. The next day Deena sold the golden axe and started a new happy life. Even though he has become rich, Deena went to work as usual. Soma: Deena where are you going in this early hour. Deena: As usual to work. Soma: Ok see you... (to himself) he is really a fool. Having become rich still he goes to work instead of enjoying his life. Oh.. Let me follow him to find out where he chops his woods. Soma followed Deena to the forest. Deena went near the river and started his work. Soma: Ah!... this is the river where his axe slipped. Let me wait till he leaves this place. Soma waited till Deena left. Soma immediately went to the river. And deliberately dropped his axe in to the river. Soma: Oh God, please help me to get back my axe. God appeared. God: Why are you crying my son? Soma: Mother my axe fell into the river. Please help me. God: This guy is playing with me. Let me teach him a lesson. God took out his iron axe first. God: Is this your axe? Soma: What Deena told his wife is that God showed the golden axe first? But now she is showing my iron axe. No problem. Let me tell the answer. Soma: No God then took out silver axe and showed it to him God: Is this your axe? Soma: No...no... not this one God took out the golden axe God: Is this your axe? Soma: Yes yes yes.. this one is mine. God was furious now. God: How dare you? Telling lies to me? You should be punished for telling lies. Saying this God disappeared with the axe. Soma: My axe... my axe. God Please forgive me for telling lies. Please give back my iron axe. Oh God... What will I do now? All his shouting went useless. Soma returned home without the axe which was his only property. But he had learnt his lesson.</h2><br />

Good<br /><br />(Are we out of the wo-o-ods?!)<br /><br />Looking at it now<br />Last December (last december)<br />We were built to fall apart<br />And fall back together (back together)<br />Your neck is hanging from my neck<br />The night we couldn't quite forget, when we decided<br />We decided, to move the furniture so we could dance<br />Baby like we stood a chance<br />Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying<br />And I remember thinkin'<br /><br />(Are we out of the wo-o-ods?!)<br /><br />Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?<br />20 stitches in the hospital room<br />And you started cryin', baby I did too<br />But when the Sun came up, I was lookin' at you<br />Remember when we couldn't take the heat<br />I walked out and said I'm settin' you free<br />But the monsters turned out to be just trees<br />And when the Sun came up, you were lookin' at me<br />You were lookin' at me<br />You were lookin' at me, oohI remember, oh I remember<br /><br /><br />Out Of The Woods<br /><br />



Looking at it now<br />
It all seems so simple<br />
We were lying on your couch<br />
I remember<br />
You took a Polaroid of us<br />
Then discovered (then discovered)<br />
The rest of the world was black and white<br />
But we were in screaming color<br />
And I remember thinking…<br /><br />[Chorus 2x:]<br />
Are we out of the woods yet?<br />
Are we out of the woods yet?<br />
Are we out of the woods yet?<br />
Are we out of the woods?<br />
Are we in the clear yet?<br />
Are we in the clear yet?<br />
Are we in the clear yet?<br />
In the clear yet?<br />
Good<br /><br />
Are we out of the woods?<br /><br />
Looking at it now<br />
Last December (last December)<br />
We were built to fall apart<br />
Then fall back together (back together)<br />
Your necklace hanging from my neck<br />
The night we couldn't quite forget<br />
When we decided (we decided)<br />
To move the furniture so we could dance,<br />
Baby, like we stood a chance<br />
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying<br />
And I remember thinkin'<br /><br />[Chorus 2x]<br /><br />
(Are we out of the woods?!)<br /><br />
Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?<br />
Twenty stitches in the hospital room<br />
When you started cryin', baby, I did, too<br />
But when the sun came up, I was lookin' at you<br />
Remember when we couldn't take the heat<br />
I walked out and said, "I'm settin' you free,"<br />
But the monsters turned out to be just trees<br />
And when the sun came up, you were lookin' at me<br />
You were lookin' at me<br />
You were lookin' at me,<br />
I remember, oh, I remember<br /><br />[Chorus 4x]<br /><br />
