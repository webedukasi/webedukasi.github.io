                                            Once upon a time there lived a little girl named Snow White.  She lived with her aunt and uncle because her parents were dead. One day she heard her uncle and aunt talking about leaving Snow White in the castle because they both wanted to go to America and they didn’t have enough money to take Snow White. Snow White didn’t want her uncle and aunt to do that so she decided that it would be best if she ran away.  The next morning she ran away into the woods.  She was very tired and hungry.  Then she saw a little cottage.  She knocked but no one answered so she went inside and fell asleep. Meanwhile, the seven dwarfs were coming home from work.  There they found Snow White sleeping.  Then Snow White woke up.  She saw the dwarfs. The dwarfs said, “What is your name?” Snow White said, “My name is Snow White.” Then, Snow White told the dwarfs the whole story.

                            9. Snow White
Once upon a time there lived a little girl named Snow White. She lived with her aunt and uncle because her parents were dead.
One day she heard her uncle and aunt talking about leaving Snow White in the castle because they both wanted to go to America and they didn’t have enough money to take Snow White.
Snow White didn’t want her uncle and aunt to do that so she decided that it would be best if she ran away. The next morning she ran away into the woods. She was very tired and hungry. Then she saw a little cottage. She knocked but no one answered so she went inside and fell asleep.
Meanwhile, the seven dwarfs were coming home from work. There they found Snow White sleeping. Then Snow White woke up. She saw the dwarfs.
The dwarfs said, “What is your name?”
Snow White said, “My name is Snow White.”
Then, Snow White told the dwarfs the whole story.
The dwarfs said, “If you want, you may live here with us.”
Snow White answered, “Oh, could I? Thank you.”
Finally, Snow White and the seven dwarfs lived happily ever after.

                        Latar Tempat di Cerita <strong>Snow White and The Seven DwarfsB<br /></strong><br />- Hutan<br />- Rumah Kurcaci<br />- Istana Kerajaan<strong><br /></strong>- Istana Sang Ratu Jahat<br /><br />Maaf kalo salah...<strong><br /></strong>Dahulu kala hiduplah seorang putri cantik dengan kulit yang terang (putih) dan mata biru. Dia begitu putih sehingga ia diberi nama Putri Salju. Ibunya meninggal saat Putri Salju masih bayi dan ayahnya menikah lagi. Ratu ini sangat cantik tapi dia juga sangat kejam.<br /><br />bu tirinya (putri salju) yang jahat ingin menjadi wanita yang paling cantik di kerajaan dan dia sering bertanya kepada cermin sihirnya, "Cermin! Cermin di dinding! Siapa yang tercantik dari mereka (perempuan di seluruh kerajaan)semua? "Dan cermin ajaib berkata," Kamu, Yang Mulia! "Tapi suatu hari, cermin itu menjawab," Putri salju adalah yang tercantik  dari mereka semua! "Ratu jahat sangat marah dan cemburu kepada Putri Salju. Dia memerintahkan pemburu untuk membawa Putri Salju ke hutan dan membunuhnya. "Aku ingin kau membawa kembali hatinya," perintahnya. Tapi ketika pemburu mencapai hutan dengan putri salju, dia merasa kasihan padanya dan membebaskannya. Dia membunuh rusa dan mengambil hatinya untuk ratu jahat dan mengatakan kepadanya bahwa ia telah membunuh Putri Salju. Putri Salju pun kemudian mengembara di hutan sepanjang malam, menangis.<br /><br />Ketika menjelang siang, dia datang ke sebuah pondok kecil dan masuk ke dalam. tidak ada seorangpun disana (di dalam pondok), tapi dia menemukan tujuh piring di atas meja dan tujuh tempat tidur kecil di kamar tidur. Dia memasak makanan yang enak dan membersihkan rumah dan kelelahan, akhirnya tidur di salah satu tempat tidur kecil. Pada malam hari, tujuh kurcaci yang tinggal di pondok pulang dan menemukan Putri Salju tidur. Ketika ia bangun dan mengatakan kepada mereka kisahnya, tujuh kurcaci memintanya untuk tinggal bersama mereka. Ketika kurcaci pergi, Putri Salju akan membuat makanan lezat untuk mereka. Para kurcaci mencintainya dan menyayanginya. Setiap pagi, ketika mereka meninggalkan rumah, mereka memerintahkan dia untuk tidak pernah membuka pintu untuk orang asing.<br />Sementara itu, di istana, ratu jahat kembali bertanya, "Cermin! Cermin di Siapa yang tercantik dari mereka.<br />Cermin menjawab, Putri salju adalah yang tercantik dari mereka semua! Dia tinggal dengan tujuh kurcaci di hutan! "Si ibu tiri jahat sangat marah. Dia sebenarnya adalah  seorang penyihir yang tahu bagaimana membuat ramuan sihir. Dia sekarang membuat ramuan beracun dan mencelupkan apel merah mengkilap ke dalamnya. Lalu ia menyamar sebagai seorang wanita petani tua dan pergi ke hutan dengan apel. Dia mengetuk pintu pondok dan berkata "Wahai anak kecil! Biarkan aku masuk! Lihat apa yang saya punya untuk (diberikan kepada) Anda! "Kata Putri salju," Saya sangat menyesal, wanita tua, saya tidak boleh membiarkan Anda masuk! Tujuh kurcaci telah mengatakan kepada saya untuk tidak berbicara dengan orang asing! "Tapi kemudian, Putri Salju melihat apel merah mengkilap, dan membuka pintu. Si penyihir jahat menawarinya apel dan ketika ia mengigit sedikit bagian dari apel tersebut Putri Salju jatuh dan akhirnya ter tidur nyenyak. Ibu tiri yang jahat kembali ke istana dan bertanya kepada cermin, "Cermin! Cermin di dinding! Siapa yang tercantik dari mereka semua? "Jawab Cermin," Kamu, Yang Mulia! "Dan dia sangat senang.<br />Ketika tujuh kurcaci datang ke rumah, mereka menemukan Putri Salju tergeletak di lantai, mereka sangat marah. Mereka menangis sepanjang malam dan kemudian membangun sebuah peti kaca untuk Putri Salju. Mereka menyimpan peti kaca tersebut di depan pondok. Suatu hari, Pangeran Tampan akan melewati pondok dan ia melihat Putri Salju berbaring di peti mati. Dia mengatakan kepada para kurcaci, "oh! oh! Dia begitu cantik! Saya ingin menciumnya! "Dan dia melakukannya. Segera, Putri Salju membuka matanya. Dia hidup kembali! Sang pangeran dan tujuh kurcaci sangat senang. Si Pangeran yang tampan pun  menikahi  Putri Salju dan membawanya ke istananya dan hidup bahagia selamanya.<br /><br />Semoga Membantu<br /><br /><br /><br />
