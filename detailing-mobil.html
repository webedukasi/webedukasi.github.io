                                            A caption, also known as a cutline, is a text that appears below an image. Most captions draw attention to something in the image that is not obvious, such as its relevance to the text. Captions can consist of a few words of description, or several sentences. Along with the title, lead, and section headings, captions are the most commonly read words in an article, so they should be succinct and informative. Captions also include a short title or heading of anarticle in a magazine or newspaper. Words shown on a cinemaor television screen to establish the scene of a story are alsocalled captions. Captions can also be inserted below/above charts, figures, graphics and tables.  There are several criteria for a good caption. A good caption clearly identifies the subject of the picture without detailing the obvious. It is succinct. It establishes the picture's relevance to the article, provides context for the picture, and draws the reader into the article.SOAL!  1. Can you mention some attitude  problems?2.

                                            Before I begin my actual question, I would like to apologize in advance for my inadequate level of English proficiency. I am not a native speaker of the world's current lingua franca which unfortunately leads to me making numerous embarrassing mistakes being made whenever I attempt to communicate using this language. Whenever I am reminded of how I lack the ability to convey my thoughts in an eloquent manner, I feel as though I have committed a cardinal sin, as though every English teacher in the world is simultaneously shaking their head and sighing due to how utterly disappointed they are at me.Although I know that saying sorry to those of you who are reading my comment will not change the fact that I fail miserably to write and speak perfect English, I am writing this as a way to deter a certain type of people who cannot stand poor English (Also known informally as Grammar Nazis) from mocking me by posting unwanted and unnecessary comments detailing my every blunder. In my humble opinion, making grammatical errors should be perfectly acceptable as native speakers should not expect non-native speakers to be able to communicate in their second or third languages eloquently. If you are able to completely understand what the other person wrote, is there really a problem with what they've written? No, because the entire concept of communication is the exchange of information between other intelligent beings, which means that no matter how the exchange of information is made, as long as the information is accurately shared there is not a fundamental issue with their ability to communicate. To see it in another way, remember that someone who isn't fluent in English is fluent in another language. When you think about it this way, isn't it impressive for someone to speak a second language in any capacity? Having empathy and respect are qualities that are sorely missing for far too many people these days, especially on the internet.That being said, I am aware that not all netizens who correct others are doing it to ridicule and shame. There are some who do so with the intent to help others improve and grow. However, displaying the failures of other people publicly will cause the person who is criticized to feel negative emotions such as shame and sadness due to the fact that their mistake has been made obvious which severely undermines the point they were trying to make in spite of their unfamiliarity with the English language. In most circumstances people are not looking for language help when they post anything online. Most people just want to enjoy themselves and have a good time on the internet which is why I would not encourage correcting other people regardless of your intentions. If you really do want to help others with their spelling or grammar, I would highly recommend you to help via messaging privately because not only will you not embarrass anyone, you can also go more in-depth with your explanation which I'm sure the other person will greatly appreciate if they want help, but I digress. I know that I've written a bit of an essay, but I hope I've made my points clear.Anyways, here is the question i wanted to ask:there's no question, get a free point.​</a>

                                            Text for number 21-23
 The economic world has been buzzing for the last two years now as investors, homeowners and trend analysts alike attempt to identify the causes and ultimate effects, of the a sub-prime lending mortgage crisis. Papers have been filled with headlines detailing the mass evictions, leading in particularly tragic cases to entire communities being reduced to little more than shanty towns. The onus seems to be to find which people in which industry are to blame, but, in the end, untangling that knotted mess may prove impossible, and even were we to reveal an identifiable cause, would that help solve the current problems?
 What is not drawing as much attention, but perhaps should be, is the effect that all of this has had not just on the value of the dollar internationally but domestically as well. The cost to rent an apartment has risen dramatically in most major metropolitan areas, as families that once owned homes are forced back into the rental market. The cost of student loans has also peaked sharply, with federal interest rates up to three times as high as the rates from a mere six years ago. Unfortunately, for the many people affected by this situation, it seems unlikely that the rising cost of a college education will come to the attention of those at the highest levels until the country sees a decrease in the number of students receiving college degrees, at which point solution may be out of our hands.
21. According to the author of the passage, the entity most likely to blame for the economic situation is…
A. The unscrupulous lending industry that failed to recognize the potential pitfalls in the sub-prime lending scheme
B. Ultimately of less import than is recognizing the far-ranging side effects and working to find a solution
C. Also solely responsible for the present weakness of the dollar in overseas markets
D. Only going to recognize the true effects of the mistakes that have been made once the results are irreversible
E. The public at large because it was the public that supported the sub-prime loans without learning what they entailed
22. The passage most likely refers to student loans in order to…
A. Decry the unreasonable interest rates that are currently being charged by some unscrupulous lenders
B. Argue that the economic problems evident in some sectors are not really as bad as they may appear superficially
C. Underscore an earlier point regarding the widespread nature of some of the economic problems related to the housing crisis
D. Support the claim that the country may eventually suffer from a lack of well-educated citizens
E. Explain why the housing costs have risen so dramatically in certain major metropolitan areas in the United States
23. The word “peaked” in the second paragraph most nearly means…
A. Reached an apex only to descend again
B. Set a precedent for future valuations
C. Quickly ascended in price
D. Artificially inflated
E. Caught nationwide attention</a>

coordinating many of the activities we do with
the children, including song time, creative play
and basic literacy and numeracy activities. I am
an excellent communicator, I ooze confidence
in my job, and I am motivated and creative
which I think are very important traits for a
Nursery Nurse.
I have attached a copy of my CV detailing
my other qualifications and achievements
for your perusal. I would be able to attend an
interview within one week and I have a four-
week notice period in my existing role should
you be interest in me joining your team.
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Kindest regards,
Jane Smith

                                            Since 1929, physicists have known that the universe is expanding. Most physicists hold that the entire observable universe was condensed into a tiny area of exceptional density and that this initial mass exploded outward in what is commonly referred to as the "Big Bang." The universe has been expanding steadily ever since this cataclysmic event and most physicists naturally assumed that this expansion must be gradually slowing down. Some theorists even predicted that the gravitational pull of the universe would cause the eventual contraction of the universe—the "Big Crunch." However, in 1998, a team of observers studying supernovae made a shocking discovery. Instead of slowing down, the expansion of the universe is accelerating. In fact, the acceleration appeared to have begun some 10 billion years ago. Later measurements of the cosmic microwave background and a survey of the distribution of galaxies seem to corroborate the initial finding that the expansion of the universe Is indeed accelerating. Cosmologists believe the most likely explanation for the acceleration of the universe's expansion is an entity known as dark energy According to theory, dark energy should account for approximately two-thirds of the total cosmic energy density. It also Is believed to be gravitationally repulsive and diffused throughout the areas of space unoccupied by galaxies. Although theoretically possible, dark energy, if it were found to exist, would provide theorists with a number of difficulties and perhaps even require an extensive rethinking of fundamental physics. Some cosmologists believe that the existence of dark energy implies the existence of subatomic particles more than thirty orders of magnitude smaller than the electron. Others have tinkered with Einstein's theory of relativity in an attempt to account for the perceived effects of dark energy. Such drastic revisions to long-held tenets have encouraged some physicists to seek a more conventional solution to the accelerating universe enigma, one that does not invoke the specter of dark energy. These theories posit more mundane explanations. such as the aggregate gravitational effect of interstellar dust. Recently, four independent groups have found evidence of the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, a phenomenon linked to the presence of dark energy. 1) 1. The passage is primarily concerned with ....

                            6. Before I begin my actual question, I would like to apologize in advance for my inadequate level of English proficiency. I am not a native speaker of the world's current lingua franca which unfortunately leads to me making numerous embarrassing mistakes being made whenever I attempt to communicate using this language. Whenever I am reminded of how I lack the ability to convey my thoughts in an eloquent manner, I feel as though I have committed a cardinal sin, as though every English teacher in the world is simultaneously shaking their head and sighing due to how utterly disappointed they are at me.Although I know that saying sorry to those of you who are reading my comment will not change the fact that I fail miserably to write and speak perfect English, I am writing this as a way to deter a certain type of people who cannot stand poor English (Also known informally as Grammar Nazis) from mocking me by posting unwanted and unnecessary comments detailing my every blunder. In my humble opinion, making grammatical errors should be perfectly acceptable as native speakers should not expect non-native speakers to be able to communicate in their second or third languages eloquently. If you are able to completely understand what the other person wrote, is there really a problem with what they've written? No, because the entire concept of communication is the exchange of information between other intelligent beings, which means that no matter how the exchange of information is made, as long as the information is accurately shared there is not a fundamental issue with their ability to communicate. To see it in another way, remember that someone who isn't fluent in English is fluent in another language. When you think about it this way, isn't it impressive for someone to speak a second language in any capacity? Having empathy and respect are qualities that are sorely missing for far too many people these days, especially on the internet.That being said, I am aware that not all netizens who correct others are doing it to ridicule and shame. There are some who do so with the intent to help others improve and grow. However, displaying the failures of other people publicly will cause the person who is criticized to feel negative emotions such as shame and sadness due to the fact that their mistake has been made obvious which severely undermines the point they were trying to make in spite of their unfamiliarity with the English language. In most circumstances people are not looking for language help when they post anything online. Most people just want to enjoy themselves and have a good time on the internet which is why I would not encourage correcting other people regardless of your intentions. If you really do want to help others with their spelling or grammar, I would highly recommend you to help via messaging privately because not only will you not embarrass anyone, you can also go more in-depth with your explanation which I'm sure the other person will greatly appreciate if they want help, but I digress. I know that I've written a bit of an essay, but I hope I've made my points clear.Anyways, here is the question i wanted to ask:there's no question, get a free point.​</h2><br />

Papers have been filled with headlines detailing the mass evictions, leading in particularly tragic cases to entire communities being reduced to little more than shanty towns. The onus seems to be to find which people in which industry are to blame, but, in the end, untangling that knotted mess may prove impossible, and even were we to reveal an identifiable cause, would that help solve the current problems?
 What is not drawing as much attention, but perhaps should be, is the effect that all of this has had not just on the value of the dollar internationally but domestically as well. The cost to rent an apartment has risen dramatically in most major metropolitan areas, as families that once owned homes are forced back into the rental market. The cost of student loans has also peaked sharply, with federal interest rates up to three times as high as the rates from a mere six years ago. Unfortunately, for the many people affected by this situation, it seems unlikely that the rising cost of a college education will come to the attention of those at the highest levels until the country sees a decrease in the number of students receiving college degrees, at which point solution may be out of our hands.
21. According to the author of the passage, the entity most likely to blame for the economic situation is…
A. The unscrupulous lending industry that failed to recognize the potential pitfalls in the sub-prime lending scheme
B. Ultimately of less import than is recognizing the far-ranging side effects and working to find a solution
C. Also solely responsible for the present weakness of the dollar in overseas markets
D. Only going to recognize the true effects of the mistakes that have been made once the results are irreversible
E. The public at large because it was the public that supported the sub-prime loans without learning what they entailed
22. The passage most likely refers to student loans in order to…
A. Decry the unreasonable interest rates that are currently being charged by some unscrupulous lenders
B. Argue that the economic problems evident in some sectors are not really as bad as they may appear superficially
C. Underscore an earlier point regarding the widespread nature of some of the economic problems related to the housing crisis
D. Support the claim that the country may eventually suffer from a lack of well-educated citizens
E. Explain why the housing costs have risen so dramatically in certain major metropolitan areas in the United States
23. The word “peaked” in the second paragraph most nearly means…
A. Reached an apex only to descend again
B. Set a precedent for future valuations
C. Quickly ascended in price
D. Artificially inflated
E. Caught nationwide attention</h2><br />

                            8. Dear Mr. Brown,
I am writing to express my interest in
the Nursery Nurse role I saw advertised in the
Chronicle News.
I am a qualified Nursery Nurse and I have
been working in this position for two years at
our local early years centre, but I have decided
I am ready to take on the new challenge of
working with the health visiting team at your
surgery. In my current role, I am responsible for
coordinating many of the activities we do with
the children, including song time, creative play
and basic literacy and numeracy activities. I am
an excellent communicator, I ooze confidence
in my job, and I am motivated and creative
which I think are very important traits for a
Nursery Nurse.
I have attached a copy of my CV detailing
my other qualifications and achievements
for your perusal. I would be able to attend an
interview within one week and I have a four-
week notice period in my existing role should
you be interest in me joining your team.
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Kindest regards,
Jane Smith

                            10. Since 1929, physicists have known that the universe is expanding. Most physicists hold that the entire observable universe was condensed into a tiny area of exceptional density and that this initial mass exploded outward in what is commonly referred to as the "Big Bang." The universe has been expanding steadily ever since this cataclysmic event and most physicists naturally assumed that this expansion must be gradually slowing down. Some theorists even predicted that the gravitational pull of the universe would cause the eventual contraction of the universe—the "Big Crunch." However, in 1998, a team of observers studying supernovae made a shocking discovery. Instead of slowing down, the expansion of the universe is accelerating. In fact, the acceleration appeared to have begun some 10 billion years ago. Later measurements of the cosmic microwave background and a survey of the distribution of galaxies seem to corroborate the initial finding that the expansion of the universe Is indeed accelerating. Cosmologists believe the most likely explanation for the acceleration of the universe's expansion is an entity known as dark energy According to theory, dark energy should account for approximately two-thirds of the total cosmic energy density. It also Is believed to be gravitationally repulsive and diffused throughout the areas of space unoccupied by galaxies. Although theoretically possible, dark energy, if it were found to exist, would provide theorists with a number of difficulties and perhaps even require an extensive rethinking of fundamental physics. Some cosmologists believe that the existence of dark energy implies the existence of subatomic particles more than thirty orders of magnitude smaller than the electron. Others have tinkered with Einstein's theory of relativity in an attempt to account for the perceived effects of dark energy. Such drastic revisions to long-held tenets have encouraged some physicists to seek a more conventional solution to the accelerating universe enigma, one that does not invoke the specter of dark energy. These theories posit more mundane explanations. such as the aggregate gravitational effect of interstellar dust. Recently, four independent groups have found evidence of the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, a phenomenon linked to the presence of dark energy. 1) 1. The passage is primarily concerned with ....
