Bandung Sea of Fire
The Bandung Sea of Fire was a historical moment for Indonesian independence. It was the intentional burning of much of the southern side of Bandung during the Indonesia national revolution.  The event came to be known as Bandung Sea of Fire or Bandung Lautan Api. Hundreds of Indonesian nationalists were singing Halo – Halo Bandung to show that they were proud of what they have done.
The British commander gave an ultimatum to the Indonesian troops to leave Bandung. The troops responded differently. They mobilized people to burn the southern part of Bandung as they left on March, 24 1946. Houses and buildings was burned deliberately created a horrified scheme.
In March 1946, a member of Indonesia militia, Mohammad Toha, during the evacuations smuggled dynamite leaved by Japanese and Dutch troops. The dynamite was smuggled into the Dutch military headquarters in Dayeuh Kolot region. Toha detonated the dynamite in warehouse. He killed himself with several Japanese and Dutch troops. The explosion of the dynamite created a small lake in the area. The name of Mohammad Toha then used for the main street in Dayeuh Kolot.
The Bandung Sea of Fire showed us that Indonesia combatants were very loyal to the country. They did not want to leave anything for the colonial and British army. The event was a great example of how Indonesian would sacrifice everything to reach their goal.

Within seven hours, about 200,000 residents of Bandung burned their homes. 	British troops as part of the Brigade MacDonald arrived in Bandung on October 12, 1945. Bandung was deliberately burned by TRI and local people. There were black smoke billowing high into the air everywhere. The British Army began to attack so fierce. The greatest battle happened in the Village name Dayeuh Kolot, in South Bandung, where there were a large ammunition depot belonging to British. In this battle, Barisan Rakyat Indonesia destroyed the ammunition depot. 	The strategy to fire Bandung was considered because the power of TRI and people’s militia was not comparable to the British forces and NICA. This incident inspired to create the famous song “Halo Halo Bandung”. To remember what they did and struggled, they built the Bandung Lautan Api monument. ​</a>

It was the intentional burning of much of the southern side of Bandung during the Indonesia national revolution.  The event came to be known as Bandung Sea of Fire or Bandung Lautan Api. Hundreds of Indonesian nationalists were singing Halo – Halo Bandung to show that they were proud of what they have done.The British commander gave an ultimatum to the Indonesian troops to leave Bandung. The troops responded differently. They mobilized people to burn the southern part of Bandung as they left on March, 24 1946. Houses and buildings was burned deliberately created a horrified scheme.In March 1946, a member of Indonesia militia, Mohammad Toha, during the evacuations smuggled dynamite leaved by Japanese and Dutch troops. The dynamite was smuggled into the Dutch military headquarters in Dayeuh Kolot region. Toha detonated the dynamite in warehouse. He killed himself with several Japanese and Dutch troops. The explosion of the dynamite created a small lake in the area. The name of Mohammad Toha then used for the main street in Dayeuh Kolot.The Bandung Sea of Fire showed us that Indonesia combatants were very loyal to the country. They did not want to leave anything for the colonial and British army. The event was a great example of how Indonesian would sacrifice everything to reach their goal.​</a>

                                            Bandung as Sea of Fire was a fire that occurred
in the city of Bandung on March 24, 1946. Within seven
hours, about 200,000 residents of Bandung burned their
homes.
British troops as part of the Brigade MacDonald
arrived in Bandung on October 12, 1945. Bandung was
deliberately burned by TRI and local people. There were
black smoke billowing high into the air everywhere. The
British Army began to attack so fierce. The greatest battle
happened in the Village name Dayeuh Kolot, in South
Bandung, where there were a large ammunition depot
belonging to British. In this battle, Barisan Rakyat
Indonesia destroyed the ammunition depot.
The strategy to fire Bandung was considered
because the power of TRI and people's militia was not
comparable to the British forces and NICA. This incident
inspired to create the famous song "Halo, Halo
Bandung"

Bandung Sea of Fire
The Bandung Sea of Fire was a historical moment for Indonesian independence. It was the intentional burning of much of the southern side of Bandung during the Indonesia national revolution.  The event came to be known as Bandung Sea of Fire or Bandung Lautan Api. Hundreds of Indonesian nationalists were singing Halo – Halo Bandung to show that they were proud of what they have done.
The British commander gave an ultimatum to the Indonesian troops to leave Bandung. The troops responded differently. They mobilized people to burn the southern part of Bandung as they left on March, 24 1946. Houses and buildings was burned deliberately created a horrified scheme.
In March 1946, a member of Indonesia militia, Mohammad Toha, during the evacuations smuggled dynamite leaved by Japanese and Dutch troops. The dynamite was smuggled into the Dutch military headquarters in Dayeuh Kolot region. Toha detonated the dynamite in warehouse. He killed himself with several Japanese and Dutch troops. The explosion of the dynamite created a small lake in the area. The name of Mohammad Toha then used for the main street in Dayeuh Kolot.
The Bandung Sea of Fire showed us that Indonesia combatants were very loyal to the country. They did not want to leave anything for the colonial and British army. The event was a great example of how Indonesian would sacrifice everything to reach their goal.

It was the intentional burning of much of the southern side of Bandung during the Indonesia national revolution.  The event came to be known as Bandung Sea of Fire or Bandung Lautan Api. Hundreds of Indonesian nationalists were singing Halo – Halo Bandung to show that they were proud of what they have done.The British commander gave an ultimatum to the Indonesian troops to leave Bandung. The troops responded differently. They mobilized people to burn the southern part of Bandung as they left on March, 24 1946. Houses and buildings was burned deliberately created a horrified scheme.In March 1946, a member of Indonesia militia, Mohammad Toha, during the evacuations smuggled dynamite leaved by Japanese and Dutch troops. The dynamite was smuggled into the Dutch military headquarters in Dayeuh Kolot region. Toha detonated the dynamite in warehouse. He killed himself with several Japanese and Dutch troops. The explosion of the dynamite created a small lake in the area. The name of Mohammad Toha then used for the main street in Dayeuh Kolot.The Bandung Sea of Fire showed us that Indonesia combatants were very loyal to the country. They did not want to leave anything for the colonial and British army. The event was a great example of how Indonesian would sacrifice everything to reach their goal.​</h2><br />

                            32. Bandung as Sea of Fire was a fire that occurred
in the city of Bandung on March 24, 1946. Within seven
hours, about 200,000 residents of Bandung burned their
homes.
British troops as part of the Brigade MacDonald
arrived in Bandung on October 12, 1945. Bandung was
deliberately burned by TRI and local people. There were
black smoke billowing high into the air everywhere. The
British Army began to attack so fierce. The greatest battle
happened in the Village name Dayeuh Kolot, in South
Bandung, where there were a large ammunition depot
belonging to British. In this battle, Barisan Rakyat
Indonesia destroyed the ammunition depot.
The strategy to fire Bandung was considered
because the power of TRI and people's militia was not
comparable to the British forces and NICA. This incident
inspired to create the famous song "Halo, Halo
Bandung"

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Bandung sebagai Laut Api adalah kebakaran yang terjadi di kota Bandung pada tanggal 24 Maret 1946. Dalam waktu tujuh jam, sekitar 200.000 penduduk Bandung membakar rumahnya. Pasukan Inggris sebagai bagian dari Brigade MacDonald tiba di Bandung pada 12 Oktober 1945 Bandung sengaja dibakar oleh TRI dan warga sekitar. Asap hitam mengepul tinggi di udara dimana-mana. Tentara Inggris mulai menyerang dengan begitu sengitnya. Pertempuran terbesar terjadi di Desa Dayeuh Kolot, di Bandung Selatan, di mana terdapat gudang amunisi besar milik Inggris. Dalam pertempuran ini, Barisan Rakyat Indonesia menghancurkan gudang amunisi tersebut. Strategi menembak Bandung dinilai karena kekuatan TRI dan milisi rakyat tidak sebanding dengan pasukan Inggris dan NICA. Kejadian ini menginspirasi terciptanya lagu terkenal “Halo Halo Bandung”. Untuk mengingat apa yang mereka lakukan dan pergumulan, mereka membangun monumen Bandung Lautan Api. Apa yang bisa kita pelajari?</p><br />
