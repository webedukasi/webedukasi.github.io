                                            Why were they very careful of the lake? Because there were …... My family likes the sea very much. When we had a holiday last year, we went to a place at the seaside and borrowed a boat from one of our friends. Then we sailed and fished on the sea all day. We also had races against other boats. When the sea was rough, we sailed on a small lake near the sea instead. We were very careful on this lake because there were a lot of sharp rocks there, and the water was shallow. We did not want to damage our friend's boat. There were not many fish in the lake, but in the sea we caught a lot with a hook, line and small pieces of bread. The fish were not very big, but they tasted very good. When the weather was fine, we sailed to the land at lunch time, collected pieces of dry wood and fried or grilled our fish over them on the beach. There is an island about a mile from our friend's house, and we sailed to it. The water was very clean there, and there was a beautiful beach with white sand and no rocks. We bathed there. It was a lot of fun. A lot of sharp rocks and shallow A lot of sharp fishes A lot of big fishes A lot of damage boats O O​</a>

                            6. Why were they very careful of the lake? Because there were …... My family likes the sea very much. When we had a holiday last year, we went to a place at the seaside and borrowed a boat from one of our friends. Then we sailed and fished on the sea all day. We also had races against other boats. When the sea was rough, we sailed on a small lake near the sea instead. We were very careful on this lake because there were a lot of sharp rocks there, and the water was shallow. We did not want to damage our friend's boat. There were not many fish in the lake, but in the sea we caught a lot with a hook, line and small pieces of bread. The fish were not very big, but they tasted very good. When the weather was fine, we sailed to the land at lunch time, collected pieces of dry wood and fried or grilled our fish over them on the beach. There is an island about a mile from our friend's house, and we sailed to it. The water was very clean there, and there was a beautiful beach with white sand and no rocks. We bathed there. It was a lot of fun. A lot of sharp rocks and shallow A lot of sharp fishes A lot of big fishes A lot of damage boats O O​</h2><br />
