                                            Underline  the indirect objects in the following paragraphs!
1.	Morg was cross. She was more than cross, she was furious. She had been chosen to mind her little brother, again. Normally she quite liked him, as he stumbled after her on his short legs, babbling in a way that made her laugh, but today there was some-thing much more exciting happening. The men were preparing to go on a hunt. There hadn't been a hunt for months. First there was too much rain and then there was too much work with the harvest. But now the wheat was in and the grain was all stored in pits. The Druid was here, bringing blessings from the gods and medicines for the villagers. So the chief had decided that it was time. Outside the men were gathering and the Druid was chanting. Morg longed to be there.
2.	But Morg was not allowed to go. She wasn't even allowed to watch. Her brother was unwell. He had an evil spirit in his chest which was making him cough and cough. He had to stay warm, and to do that, he had to be in the hut. Therefore, while her mother was fetching water, Morg had to stay in the hut too. It was dark in the hut. A warm, rich, thick darkness, lit only by the glow from the fire which burnt in the middle of the room. Later, the fire would be built up so that flames would lick the round black cauldronand heat the stew for the evening meal, but for now turf had been laid on the logs. The fire would stay hot and alive, but would not need to be fed. Morg knew that fires were as ravenous as the wolves she heard howling in the woods at night.
3.	Morg could smell the fire and the smell was as familiar to her as the smell of her mother. She could sniff and tell in a moment whether the family were burning ash branches or hazel, hawthorn or coppiced elm. To Morg, it was the smell of home. The glow from the fire lit the face of the boy who lay next to it asleep on the blanket. Morg swept the floor around him savagely. Any crumbs or discarded meat would make food for the rats, and her mother hated rats. Morg decided that today she hated her mother. She knew her mother was anxious about the cough because her sister had coughed in the same way before she had died. That didn't stop Morg from muttering a curse against the unkind-ness that kept her inside the hut. As she said it, she wished she could swallow the words back, but it was too late. She looked around worriedly. Maybe nobody had heard. She chanted a good will incantation, and crossed her fingers.
4.	Outside, she heard a hunting horn, loud and sharp across the village. Morg sidled towards the doorway. She could see light through a gap in the planks, but that was not enough. She opened the door a crack. Maybe she could watch them from here? She might just be able to catch a glimpse of what was going on. But she couldn't see anything. The fence that kept in the pigs was blocking her view. She opened the door wider, and an icy blast of wind whipped it out of her hands. It banged crash against the side of the hut. Behind her the fire crackled into life and the baby opened his eyes. Morg did not notice. She fought for control of the door. She wedged it with a stone, so that it still looked closed at first glance. She slid out and across to the corner of the pig fence.</a>

A Trip to the Beach Last weekend my family and I drove two and a half hours out of the city to get to the beach. I had never been to the beach before, so I had been excited for weeks looking forward to our trip. The drive to the beach was a bit boring. The road was really windy, and my baby brother cried a lot, which was annoying. We stopped halfway to eat the chicken sandwiches that my Dad had made that morning. They were delicious! I caught my first glimpse of the beach when we drove over a big hill and I could just see the ocean water was sparkling in the distance. As we got closer, I was amazed by the deep blue water that stretched out for as far as I could see. I couldn't wait to finally get there. We pulled up at the beach and I jumped out of the car. I ran across the sand feeling the warmth on my bare feet. It was pretty, golden color and it felt so soft We set up umbrellas and chairs and then finally got to go swimming. The water was better than I had ever imagines. It was the perfect temperature, not too hot and not too cold. I loved the feeling of the gentle waves bumping against my legs. I spent all day swimming and playing in the sand with my baby brother. We made sandcastles and dug huge holes. My day at the beach was magical, and I can't wait to visit again! Questions 1.

The following text is for questions 26 to 28.
In 1991, Shark Bay was inscribed into the UNESCO World Heritage list in recognition of its outstanding natural beauty, biological diversity, fascinating ecology and unique insights into the Earth's history. Here, you can meet the Monkey Mia dolphins, the world's largest population of dugongs, walk among the largest and oldest living fossils on the planet and discover the 30,000 year history and culture of its Indigenous people.
     The only town in the Shark Bay region is Denham. It's an eight hour drive or a two hour flight from Perth and, from here, you can join the Shark Bay World Heritage Drive, taking in all the main attractions. If you don't have wheels, there are plenty of extended tours from Perth, or day and half-day adventures from Denham.
     A closer look at this vast landscape will reveal an abundance of rare and unique plant and animal life, some of which are found nowhere else on Earth. It's home to over 100 known species of reptiles and amphibians, 240 varieties of birds, 320 types of fish, 80 different corals and 820 species of plants, including 700 flowering species. Protecting many endangered species, Shark Bay's Francois Peron National Park is one of the most important wilderness areas in Australia.       Just off-shore, in Shark Bay Marine Park, lies Dirk Hartog Island National Park - a haven for rare burrowing frogs and white fairy wrens, and a top spot for fishing, diving, snorkeling and four-wheel-drive adventures. Today, you can arrive by barge with your 4WD, chartered flight or in your own boat.
     Further south in Shark Bay, you can walk along one of only two beaches in the world formed entirely of tiny white shells, or visit the Hamelin Pool Stromatolites and get a glimpse of life on Earth over 3,500 million years ago.
     By far the most popular and spectacular attraction is Monkey Mia, where wild dolphins come in to shore every day to meet and interact with people. 
     Choose from a huge variety of accommodation options in Denham, or base yourself in Monkey Mia for an early morning dolphin encounter.

                                            Underline  the indirect objects in the following paragraphs!Morg was cross. She was more than cross, she was furious. She had been chosen to mind her little brother, again. Normally she quite liked him, as he stumbled after her on his short legs, babbling in a way that made her laugh, but today there was some-thing much more exciting happening. The men were preparing to go on a hunt. There hadn't been a hunt for months. First there was too much rain and then there was too much work with the harvest. But now the wheat was in and the grain was all stored in pits. The Druid was here, bringing blessings from the gods and medicines for the villagers. So the chief had decided that it was time. Outside the men were gathering and the Druid was chanting. Morg longed to be there.But Morg was not allowed to go. She wasn't even allowed to watch. Her brother was unwell. He had an evil spirit in his chest which was making him cough and cough. He had to stay warm, and to do that, he had to be in the hut. Therefore, while her mother was fetching water, Morg had to stay in the hut too. It was dark in the hut. A warm, rich, thick darkness, lit only by the glow from the fire which burnt in the middle of the room. Later, the fire would be built up so that flames would lick the round black cauldronand heat the stew for the evening meal, but for now turf had been laid on the logs. The fire would stay hot and alive, but would not need to be fed. Morg knew that fires were as ravenous as the wolves she heard howling in the woods at night.Morg could smell the fire and the smell was as familiar to her as the smell of her mother. She could sniff and tell in a moment whether the family were burning ash branches or hazel, hawthorn or coppiced elm. To Morg, it was the smell of home. The glow from the fire lit the face of the boy who lay next to it asleep on the blanket. Morg swept the floor around him savagely. Any crumbs or discarded meat would make food for the rats, and her mother hated rats. Morg decided that today she hated her mother. She knew her mother was anxious about the cough because her sister had coughed in the same way before she had died. That didn't stop Morg from muttering a curse against the unkind-ness that kept her inside the hut. As she said it, she wished she could swallow the words back, but it was too late. She looked around worriedly. Maybe nobody had heard. She chanted a good will incantation, and crossed her fingers.Outside, she heard a hunting horn, loud and sharp across the village. Morg sidled towards the doorway. She could see light through a gap in the planks, but that was not enough. She opened the door a crack. Maybe she could watch them from here? She might just be able to catch a glimpse of what was going on. But she couldn't see anything. The fence that kept in the pigs was blocking her view. She opened the door wider, and an icy blast of wind whipped it out of her hands. It banged crash against the side of the hut. Behind her the fire crackled into life and the baby opened his eyes. Morg did not notice. She fought for control of the door. She wedged it with a stone, so that it still looked closed at first glance. She slid out and across to the corner of the pig fence.</a>

As we had had a long walk through one of the markets of old Delhi, we stopped at a square to have a rest. After a time, we noticed a snake charmer with two large baskets at the other side of the square, so we went to have a look  at  him.  As  soon  as  he  saw  us,  he  picked  up  a  long  pipe  which  was covered with coins and opened one of the baskets. When he began to play a tune,  we  had  our  first  glimpse  of  the  snake.  It  rose  out  of  the  basket  and began to follow the movements of the pipe. We were very much surprised when the snake charmer suddenly began to play jazz and modern pop songs. The snake, however, continued to 'dance' slowly. It obviously could not tell the difference between Indian music and jazz!

Initially a hockey fan, Borg wasn't fond of tennis. At age 9 when his father brought home a tennis racket he had won as a prize in a ping-pong tournament. Borg caught the attention of tennis coach Percy Rosberg and began making regular three-hour round-trip train rides to meet with the instructor. He won his first tournament at age 11, and at 13 he won both the 13-and 14-year-old divisions of the Sweden National Junior Championships. His career on the upswing, he dropped out of school to devote himself to training full time. Borg qualified for the Swedish Davis Cup team at age 15 and won both of his singles matches. After becoming the 1972 Wimbledon junior champion and winning events in Berlin, Barcelona and Miami, he chose to be a professional tennis player. Borg first rose to prominence at Wimbledon in 1973, when adoring female fans lined up to get a glimpse of the handsome, mysterious Swede. His long blond hair tucked beneath a headband, Borg featured a distinct playing style with his two-handed backhand and topspin-heavy ground strokes. He won his first tournament just days before his 18th birthday, and two weeks later he became the youngest winner of the French Open.   12.

                                            Read the following passage.
My first day in Jakarta wasn’t really good. I booked a room via a room-booking application. My host is Reza. However, he didn’t stay in the apartment which he rented. On the first day, he kindly offered to show me to the supermarket which was located on the ground level, where there was an enormous local mall. We zigzagged left, right, straight, up an escalator, left, right, through rows and rows of stalls. We eventually came to the supermarket - and he left me there. So, I went about and did a little shop, stocking up on supplies, and then... I couldn't find my way back. What a surprise! I was stuck in this nightmare of going round and round and I just could not find my way. There were no signs in English. I asked several shopkeepers (who ignored me) and a total of three security guards if they spoke English, and they did not.
I am normally a tough person, but after an hour and a half, I was on the verge of tears. I asked one more guard desperately if they spoke English and he actually got up and found me someone who did, who was my saviour. I was on the wrong level and he pointed me in the right direction. I eventually made it back to my room and I felt relieved. Then, I tried to connect to the Wi-Fi which did not work! Reza said he would message me the password through the email, which he did - however, I needed the internet to access it. The text that I got on my phone only showed the first two lines of the message and not the password.
I was so upset I literally screamed! I had to go back into that mall. I had to try to find an Indonesian SIM card to buy data. Two unsuccessful attempts and another hour later, I had a SIM card and data on my phone. It was around 7 P.M. and I managed to capture a glimpse of the burning red sun going down, before cooking instant noodles for dinner. I was sure I was not going out again. The way everyone stared at me and the lack of help really made me uncomfortable.

                                            TEXT 1 A tablet computer, commonly shortened to tablet, is a mobile device, typically with a mobile operating system and touchscreen display processing circuitry, and rechargeable battery in a single thin, flat package. Tablets, being computers, do what other personal computers do, but lack some input/output (I/O) abilities that others have. Modern tablets largely resembles modern smartphones, the only difference being that tablets are relatively larger than smartphones, with screens 7 inches (18 cm) or larger, measured diagonally, and may not support access to a cellular network. The touchscreen display is operated by gestures executed by finger or digital pen (stylus), instead of the mouse, track-pad, and keyboard of larger computer. Two species of tablet, the slate and booklet, do not have physical keyboards and usually accept text and other input by use of a virtual keyboard shown on their touchscreen displays. To compensate for their lack of a physical keyboard, most tablets can connect to independent physical keyboards by wireless Bluetooth or USB.  TEXT 2 BALI: At a glimpse, Bintang Supermarket in Ubud looks just like other supermarkets across Bali. A banner announcing that it no longer provides plastic bags welcomes visitors upon entering the place-something that is now common practice on the island following a ban on single-use plastic bags issued by the administration earlier this year. However, something different can be seen on one of the supermarket’s fresh vegetable racks. Instead of plastic, the eggplants, water spinach, asparagus, and other fresh produce are wrapped in banana leaves and bamboo straps. “We have started to use banana leaves (for this purpose) around one month ago,”I Wayan Budiono, the assistant store manager, recently told the Jakarta Post. Budiono said the idea had come up after the place stopped providing single-use plastic bags to customers around two months ago. Not only were visitors supportive of the new policy, but they encouraged the supermarket to go one step further by minimizing the use of plastic as much as possible.

She had been chosen to mind her little brother, again. Normally she quite liked him, as he stumbled after her on his short legs, babbling in a way that made her laugh, but today there was some-thing much more exciting happening. The men were preparing to go on a hunt. There hadn't been a hunt for months. First there was too much rain and then there was too much work with the harvest. But now the wheat was in and the grain was all stored in pits. The Druid was here, bringing blessings from the gods and medicines for the villagers. So the chief had decided that it was time. Outside the men were gathering and the Druid was chanting. Morg longed to be there.But Morg was not allowed to go. She wasn't even allowed to watch. Her brother was unwell. He had an evil spirit in his chest which was making him cough and cough. He had to stay warm, and to do that, he had to be in the hut. Therefore, while her mother was fetching water, Morg had to stay in the hut too. It was dark in the hut. A warm, rich, thick darkness, lit only by the glow from the fire which burnt in the middle of the room. Later, the fire would be built up so that flames would lick the round black cauldronand heat the stew for the evening meal, but for now turf had been laid on the logs. The fire would stay hot and alive, but would not need to be fed. Morg knew that fires were as ravenous as the wolves she heard howling in the woods at night.Morg could smell the fire and the smell was as familiar to her as the smell of her mother. She could sniff and tell in a moment whether the family were burning ash branches or hazel, hawthorn or coppiced elm. To Morg, it was the smell of home. The glow from the fire lit the face of the boy who lay next to it asleep on the blanket. Morg swept the floor around him savagely. Any crumbs or discarded meat would make food for the rats, and her mother hated rats. Morg decided that today she hated her mother. She knew her mother was anxious about the cough because her sister had coughed in the same way before she had died. That didn't stop Morg from muttering a curse against the unkind-ness that kept her inside the hut. As she said it, she wished she could swallow the words back, but it was too late. She looked around worriedly. Maybe nobody had heard. She chanted a good will incantation, and crossed her fingers.Outside, she heard a hunting horn, loud and sharp across the village. Morg sidled towards the doorway. She could see light through a gap in the planks, but that was not enough. She opened the door a crack. Maybe she could watch them from here? She might just be able to catch a glimpse of what was going on. But she couldn't see anything. The fence that kept in the pigs was blocking her view. She opened the door wider, and an icy blast of wind whipped it out of her hands. It banged crash against the side of the hut. Behind her the fire crackled into life and the baby opened his eyes. Morg did not notice. She fought for control of the door. She wedged it with a stone, so that it still looked closed at first glance. She slid out and across to the corner of the pig fence.</a>

1.	Even the most seasoned and savvy clinician views lupus warily, considering it one of the most bewildering diseases in all of medicine. This situation should not be a surprise since the manifestations of lupus are dizzying in their variety and exasperating in their subtlety. Furthermore, although lupus has been at the heart of immunology research for decades, investigators have yet to figure out its basis. Lupus represents a blatant violat-ion of the most fundamental laws of the immune system. Nevertheless, the disturbances that dangerously turn self into non-self remain totally obscure.
2.	The image of lupus adds to the confusion, although lupus actually has two competing images. These images, despite their differences, represent lupus's trademarks, its 'brand identity' so to speak. Lupus got its name from the wolf; its usual symbol, however, is the butterfly. I doubt that there are any two species as unlike one another in attitude, color, and emotional resonance as the wolf and the butterfly. Even if a misnomer, the word schizophrenic rightly describes this fierce battle of identity.
3.	Branding a specific disease with the image of a creature comes with its hazards, and efforts to link a disease with a member of the animal kingdom are, in fact, unusual. Among the few associations that come to mind are icthyosis to describe skin that looks like fish scales; leonine facies, the lion-like visage of patients with lepromatous leprosy; and elephantiasis, the thickened skin and bulging extremities from filariasis.</a>

Painting well is hard. And the traditionalist painter tries to paint well to better convey emotions to fellow humans. We cannot deny that is it much easier to identify with a (13)... work of art, that displays a realistic aspect of life, than with modern abstract work. It is a wildly accepted truth. So, if the human world needs connection beauty, and reflections, that makes traditional art very important. And (14)... realistically is very hard.

Most of the big names we hear today went through this process I am going through today, and had a similar lifestyle.

                                            Lawang Sewu is an important place in Semarang and for many years tourists have been returning to Semarang only to have a glimpse of this amazing place here. They love coming here simply because of the distinctive Dutch symbolism and the immensely long corridors leading to the offices on the other side.
Lawang Sewu is famous for the Thousand Doors and windows and the fascinating long winding windows representing the Dutch Symbolism of the places.
The building has numerous long winding corridors which open out to the offices on one side of the office and the other end of the building on the other hand. It is a famous landmark on the region of Semarang.
The place was actually built as the main colonial office for the Dutch and was then taken over by Japanese government. This place was important because it was used for giving shelter to the soldiers here. The place was often considered to be haunted place as many people believed that the place was inhabited by spirits and ghosts.
However, later the place was converted into a heritage site and many come to visit the place during their holidays or vacation while coming to visit Semarang.

The men were preparing to go on a hunt. There hadn't been a hunt for months. First there was too much rain and then there was too much work with the harvest. But now the wheat was in and the grain was all stored in pits. The Druid was here, bringing blessings from the gods and medicines for the villagers. So the chief had decided that it was time.

Therefore, while her mother was fetching water, Morg had to stay in the hut too. It was dark in the hut. A warm, rich, thick darkness, lit only by the glow from the fire which burnt in the middle of the room. Later, the fire would be built up so that flames would lick the round black cauldronand heat the stew for the evening meal, but for now turf had been laid on the logs.

She could sniff and tell in a moment whether the family were burning ash branches or hazel, hawthorn or coppiced elm. To Morg, it was the smell of home. The glow from the fire lit the face of the boy who lay next to it asleep on the blanket. Morg swept the floor around him savagely. Any crumbs or discarded meat would make food for the rats, and her mother hated rats. Morg decided that today she hated her mother. She knew her mother was anxious about the cough because her sister had coughed in the same way before she had died. That didn't stop Morg from muttering a curse against the unkind-ness that kept her inside the hut. As she said it, she wished she could swallow the words back, but it was too late.

She might just be able to catch a glimpse of what was going on. But she couldn't see anything. The fence that kept in the pigs was blocking her view. She opened the door wider, and an icy blast of wind whipped it out of her hands. It banged crash against the side of the hut. Behind her the fire crackled into life and the baby opened his eyes.

A Trip to the Beach Last weekend my family and I drove two and a half hours out of the city to get to the beach. I had never been to the beach before, so I had been excited for weeks looking forward to our trip. The drive to the beach was a bit boring. The road was really windy, and my baby brother cried a lot, which was annoying. We stopped halfway to eat the chicken sandwiches that my Dad had made that morning. They were delicious! I caught my first glimpse of the beach when we drove over a big hill and I could just see the ocean water was sparkling in the distance. As we got closer, I was amazed by the deep blue water that stretched out for as far as I could see. I couldn't wait to finally get there. We pulled up at the beach and I jumped out of the car. I ran across the sand feeling the warmth on my bare feet. It was pretty, golden color and it felt so soft We set up umbrellas and chairs and then finally got to go swimming. The water was better than I had ever imagines. It was the perfect temperature, not too hot and not too cold. I loved the feeling of the gentle waves bumping against my legs.

                                            READING SESSION Alexis de Tocqueville, the French political scientist, historian, philosopher and politician, is the most famoues for a four-volume book he wrote called “Democracy in America”. He came to America in 1831 to study the American form of democracy and what it might mean to the rest of the world. After a visit of only nine months, he wrote a remarkable book which is regarded as a classic. De Tocqueville had unusual power of observation. He described not only the democrativ system of government and how it operatedm but also its effect in how American think, feel, and act. Many scholats believe he had a deeper understanding of traditional American beliefs and values than anyone else who has written about the United States. What is so remarkable is that many of these traits which he observed nearly 200 years ago, are still visible and meaningful today. His observations are also important because the timing of his visit, the 1830s, was before America was industrialized. This was the era of the small farmer, the small businessman, and the settling of the western frontier. It was the period of history when the traditional values of the new country were newly established. In just a generation, some 40 years since the adoption of the US. Constitution, the new form of government had already produced a society of people with unique values. He was, however, a neutral observer and saw both the good and bad sides of there qualities.The first part of “Democracy in America” was written in 1831-32 and published in 1835. A highly positive and optimistic account of American government and society, the book was very well received. He attempted to get a glimpse of the essence of American society, all the while promoting his own philosophy: the equaling of the classes and the inevitable depth of aristocratic privilage. The rest of the book he labored on four years, and in 1840 the second part was published. This was substantially more pessimistic than the first, warning of the dangers despotism and governmental centralization, and applying his ideas and criticisms more directly to France. As a result, it was not received as well as the first part, except in England where it was acclaimed highly.(Adapted) 1.	What is the passage primarily about?a.	Alexis de Tocquevilleb.

                                            Lawang Sewu is an important place in Semarang and for many years tourists have been returning to Semarang only to have a glimpse of this amazing place here. They love coming here simply because of the distinctive Dutch symbolism and the immensely long corridors leading to the offices on the other side.
Lawang Sewu is famous for the Thousand Doors and windows and the fascinating long winding windows representing the Dutch Symbolism of the places.
The building has numerous long winding corridors which open out to the offices on one side of the office and the other end of the building on the other hand. It is a famous landmark on the region of Semarang.
The place was actually built as the main colonial office for the Dutch and was then taken over by Japanese government. This place was important because it was used for giving shelter to the soldiers here. The place was often considered to be haunted place as many people believed that the place was inhabited by spirits and ghosts.
However, later the place was converted into a heritage site and many come to visit the place during their holidays or vacation while coming to visit Semarang.

                            6. Underline  the indirect objects in the following paragraphs!
1.	Morg was cross. She was more than cross, she was furious. She had been chosen to mind her little brother, again. Normally she quite liked him, as he stumbled after her on his short legs, babbling in a way that made her laugh, but today there was some-thing much more exciting happening. The men were preparing to go on a hunt. There hadn't been a hunt for months. First there was too much rain and then there was too much work with the harvest. But now the wheat was in and the grain was all stored in pits. The Druid was here, bringing blessings from the gods and medicines for the villagers. So the chief had decided that it was time. Outside the men were gathering and the Druid was chanting. Morg longed to be there.
2.	But Morg was not allowed to go. She wasn't even allowed to watch. Her brother was unwell. He had an evil spirit in his chest which was making him cough and cough. He had to stay warm, and to do that, he had to be in the hut. Therefore, while her mother was fetching water, Morg had to stay in the hut too. It was dark in the hut. A warm, rich, thick darkness, lit only by the glow from the fire which burnt in the middle of the room. Later, the fire would be built up so that flames would lick the round black cauldronand heat the stew for the evening meal, but for now turf had been laid on the logs. The fire would stay hot and alive, but would not need to be fed. Morg knew that fires were as ravenous as the wolves she heard howling in the woods at night.
3.	Morg could smell the fire and the smell was as familiar to her as the smell of her mother. She could sniff and tell in a moment whether the family were burning ash branches or hazel, hawthorn or coppiced elm. To Morg, it was the smell of home. The glow from the fire lit the face of the boy who lay next to it asleep on the blanket. Morg swept the floor around him savagely. Any crumbs or discarded meat would make food for the rats, and her mother hated rats. Morg decided that today she hated her mother. She knew her mother was anxious about the cough because her sister had coughed in the same way before she had died. That didn't stop Morg from muttering a curse against the unkind-ness that kept her inside the hut. As she said it, she wished she could swallow the words back, but it was too late. She looked around worriedly. Maybe nobody had heard. She chanted a good will incantation, and crossed her fingers.
4.	Outside, she heard a hunting horn, loud and sharp across the village. Morg sidled towards the doorway. She could see light through a gap in the planks, but that was not enough. She opened the door a crack. Maybe she could watch them from here? She might just be able to catch a glimpse of what was going on. But she couldn't see anything. The fence that kept in the pigs was blocking her view. She opened the door wider, and an icy blast of wind whipped it out of her hands. It banged crash against the side of the hut. Behind her the fire crackled into life and the baby opened his eyes. Morg did not notice. She fought for control of the door. She wedged it with a stone, so that it still looked closed at first glance. She slid out and across to the corner of the pig fence.</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Traditional art has been affected by the development of technology, causing some people to argue that digital painting is the way forward. However, traditional painting will always be different from digital painting, and there are several reasons why traditional art should still be appreciated. Firstly, traditional art captures a cumulative temperament and reveals it over time. Secondly, it can convey a set of feelings and emotions that digital art is unable to. Thirdly, the painter's abilities with the brush and paint are an important aspect of traditional art. The painter is not only able to capture the subject matter, but also able to decide how to present it. The process of creating traditional art has a handmade feel that is appreciated by many. It is a way of being that invites us to live within the art and strive to understand it. Even if one knows nothing about the techniques used, the connection between the artist and the artwork is still important. The battles fought by the artist during the construction of the artwork are also appreciated. Traditional art displays a realistic aspect of life that modern abstract art often lacks. The human world needs the connection, beauty, and reflections that traditional art provides.</p><br />

The following text is for questions 26 to 28.
In 1991, Shark Bay was inscribed into the UNESCO World Heritage list in recognition of its outstanding natural beauty, biological diversity, fascinating ecology and unique insights into the Earth's history. Here, you can meet the Monkey Mia dolphins, the world's largest population of dugongs, walk among the largest and oldest living fossils on the planet and discover the 30,000 year history and culture of its Indigenous people.
     The only town in the Shark Bay region is Denham. It's an eight hour drive or a two hour flight from Perth and, from here, you can join the Shark Bay World Heritage Drive, taking in all the main attractions. If you don't have wheels, there are plenty of extended tours from Perth, or day and half-day adventures from Denham.
     A closer look at this vast landscape will reveal an abundance of rare and unique plant and animal life, some of which are found nowhere else on Earth. It's home to over 100 known species of reptiles and amphibians, 240 varieties of birds, 320 types of fish, 80 different corals and 820 species of plants, including 700 flowering species. Protecting many endangered species, Shark Bay's Francois Peron National Park is one of the most important wilderness areas in Australia.       Just off-shore, in Shark Bay Marine Park, lies Dirk Hartog Island National Park - a haven for rare burrowing frogs and white fairy wrens, and a top spot for fishing, diving, snorkeling and four-wheel-drive adventures. Today, you can arrive by barge with your 4WD, chartered flight or in your own boat.
     Further south in Shark Bay, you can walk along one of only two beaches in the world formed entirely of tiny white shells, or visit the Hamelin Pool Stromatolites and get a glimpse of life on Earth over 3,500 million years ago.
     By far the most popular and spectacular attraction is Monkey Mia, where wild dolphins come in to shore every day to meet and interact with people. 
     Choose from a huge variety of accommodation options in Denham, or base yourself in Monkey Mia for an early morning dolphin encounter.

                            11. Underline  the indirect objects in the following paragraphs!Morg was cross. She was more than cross, she was furious. She had been chosen to mind her little brother, again. Normally she quite liked him, as he stumbled after her on his short legs, babbling in a way that made her laugh, but today there was some-thing much more exciting happening. The men were preparing to go on a hunt. There hadn't been a hunt for months. First there was too much rain and then there was too much work with the harvest. But now the wheat was in and the grain was all stored in pits. The Druid was here, bringing blessings from the gods and medicines for the villagers. So the chief had decided that it was time. Outside the men were gathering and the Druid was chanting. Morg longed to be there.But Morg was not allowed to go. She wasn't even allowed to watch. Her brother was unwell. He had an evil spirit in his chest which was making him cough and cough. He had to stay warm, and to do that, he had to be in the hut. Therefore, while her mother was fetching water, Morg had to stay in the hut too. It was dark in the hut. A warm, rich, thick darkness, lit only by the glow from the fire which burnt in the middle of the room. Later, the fire would be built up so that flames would lick the round black cauldronand heat the stew for the evening meal, but for now turf had been laid on the logs. The fire would stay hot and alive, but would not need to be fed. Morg knew that fires were as ravenous as the wolves she heard howling in the woods at night.Morg could smell the fire and the smell was as familiar to her as the smell of her mother. She could sniff and tell in a moment whether the family were burning ash branches or hazel, hawthorn or coppiced elm. To Morg, it was the smell of home. The glow from the fire lit the face of the boy who lay next to it asleep on the blanket. Morg swept the floor around him savagely. Any crumbs or discarded meat would make food for the rats, and her mother hated rats. Morg decided that today she hated her mother. She knew her mother was anxious about the cough because her sister had coughed in the same way before she had died. That didn't stop Morg from muttering a curse against the unkind-ness that kept her inside the hut. As she said it, she wished she could swallow the words back, but it was too late. She looked around worriedly. Maybe nobody had heard. She chanted a good will incantation, and crossed her fingers.Outside, she heard a hunting horn, loud and sharp across the village. Morg sidled towards the doorway. She could see light through a gap in the planks, but that was not enough. She opened the door a crack. Maybe she could watch them from here? She might just be able to catch a glimpse of what was going on. But she couldn't see anything. The fence that kept in the pigs was blocking her view. She opened the door wider, and an icy blast of wind whipped it out of her hands. It banged crash against the side of the hut. Behind her the fire crackled into life and the baby opened his eyes. Morg did not notice. She fought for control of the door. She wedged it with a stone, so that it still looked closed at first glance. She slid out and across to the corner of the pig fence.</h2><br />
                        terjemahannya:Garisbawahi objek tidak langsung di paragraf berikut!<br /><br />Morg adalah salib. Dia lebih dari sekadar salib, dia sangat marah. Dia telah dipilih untuk memikirkan adik laki-lakinya, lagi. Biasanya dia sangat menyukainya, karena dia menemukan kakinya yang pendek, mengoceh dengan cara yang membuatnya tertawa, tetapi hari ini ada sesuatu yang lebih menyenangkan terjadi. Orang-orang itu bersiap untuk pergi berburu. Tidak ada perburuan selama berbulan-bulan. Pertama ada terlalu banyak hujan dan kemudian ada terlalu banyak pekerjaan dengan panen. Tapi sekarang gandum sudah masuk dan biji-bijian itu semuanya disimpan di dalam lubang. Druid ada di sini, membawa berkah dari para dewa dan obat-obatan untuk penduduk desa. Jadi, sang ketua memutuskan bahwa sudah waktunya. Di luar para pria sedang berkumpul dan Druid sedang melantunkan. Morg ingin berada di sana.<br /><br />Tapi Morg tidak diizinkan pergi. Dia bahkan tidak diizinkan untuk menonton. Kakaknya tidak sehat. Dia memiliki roh jahat di dadanya yang membuatnya batuk dan batuk. Dia harus tetap hangat, dan untuk melakukan itu, dia harus berada di dalam pondok. Karena itu, ketika ibunya mengambil air, Morg harus tinggal di pondok juga. Gelap di dalam pondok. Suatu kegelapan yang hangat, kaya, tebal, hanya diterangi oleh cahaya dari api yang membakar di tengah ruangan. Kemudian, api akan dibangun sehingga api akan menjilat kuali hitam bulat dan memanaskan rebusan untuk makan malam, tetapi untuk saat ini rumput telah diletakkan di kayu gelondongan. Api akan tetap panas dan hidup, tetapi tidak perlu diberi makan. Morg tahu bahwa kebakaran sama rakusnya dengan serigala yang dia dengar melolong di hutan pada malam hari.<br /><br />Morg bisa mencium bau api dan baunya sama familiernya dengan bau ibunya. Dia bisa mengendus dan mengatakan pada suatu saat apakah keluarga membakar cabang-cabang abu atau hazel, hawthorn atau elm coppiced. Untuk Morg, itu bau rumah. Cahaya dari api menyinari wajah bocah lelaki yang berbaring di sebelahnya tertidur di atas selimut. Morg menyapu lantai di sekitarnya dengan kejam. Setiap remah atau daging yang dibuang akan membuat makanan untuk tikus, dan ibunya membenci tikus. Morg memutuskan bahwa hari ini dia membenci ibunya. Dia tahu ibunya cemas tentang batuk karena kakaknya batuk dengan cara yang sama sebelum dia meninggal. Itu tidak menghentikan Morg dari menggumamkan kutukan melawan kejahatan yang membuatnya di dalam gubuk. Saat dia mengatakannya, dia berharap dia bisa menelan kembali kata-katanya, tetapi sudah terlambat. Dia melihat sekeliling dengan khawatir. Mungkin tidak ada yang mendengarnya. Dia melantunkan niat baik akan mantra, dan menyilangkan jari-jarinya.<br /><br />Di luar, ia mendengar tanduk berburu, keras dan tajam melintasi desa. Morg beringsut menuju ambang pintu. Dia bisa melihat cahaya melalui celah di papan, tapi itu tidak cukup. Dia membuka pintu sedikit. Mungkin dia bisa menontonnya dari sini? Dia mungkin bisa melihat sekilas apa yang sedang terjadi. Tapi dia tidak bisa melihat apa pun. Pagar yang disimpan di babi menghalangi pandangannya. Dia membuka pintu lebih lebar, dan embusan angin dingin mencambuknya dari tangannya. Itu menabrak tabrakan di sisi gubuk. Di belakangnya api berderak menjadi hidup dan bayi itu membuka matanya. Morg tidak memperhatikan. Dia berjuang untuk mengendalikan pintu. Dia menjepitnya dengan batu, sehingga masih terlihat tertutup pada pandangan pertama. Dia meluncur keluar dan menyeberang ke pojok pagar babi.<br />

                            13. Not very musical
As we had had a long walk through one of the markets of old Delhi, we stopped at a square to have a rest. After a time, we noticed a snake charmer with two large baskets at the other side of the square, so we went to have a look  at  him.  As  soon  as  he  saw  us,  he  picked  up  a  long  pipe  which  was covered with coins and opened one of the baskets. When he began to play a tune,  we  had  our  first  glimpse  of  the  snake.  It  rose  out  of  the  basket  and began to follow the movements of the pipe. We were very much surprised when the snake charmer suddenly began to play jazz and modern pop songs. The snake, however, continued to 'dance' slowly. It obviously could not tell the difference between Indian music and jazz!

                            14. Questions 12  to 14 refer to the following text.   Björn Rune Borg was born on June 6, 1956, in Stockholm, Sweden, to parents Rune and Margarethe. Initially a hockey fan, Borg wasn't fond of tennis. At age 9 when his father brought home a tennis racket he had won as a prize in a ping-pong tournament. Borg caught the attention of tennis coach Percy Rosberg and began making regular three-hour round-trip train rides to meet with the instructor. He won his first tournament at age 11, and at 13 he won both the 13-and 14-year-old divisions of the Sweden National Junior Championships. His career on the upswing, he dropped out of school to devote himself to training full time. Borg qualified for the Swedish Davis Cup team at age 15 and won both of his singles matches. After becoming the 1972 Wimbledon junior champion and winning events in Berlin, Barcelona and Miami, he chose to be a professional tennis player. Borg first rose to prominence at Wimbledon in 1973, when adoring female fans lined up to get a glimpse of the handsome, mysterious Swede. His long blond hair tucked beneath a headband, Borg featured a distinct playing style with his two-handed backhand and topspin-heavy ground strokes. He won his first tournament just days before his 18th birthday, and two weeks later he became the youngest winner of the French Open.   12.

                            18. Read the following passage.
My first day in Jakarta wasn’t really good. I booked a room via a room-booking application. My host is Reza. However, he didn’t stay in the apartment which he rented. On the first day, he kindly offered to show me to the supermarket which was located on the ground level, where there was an enormous local mall. We zigzagged left, right, straight, up an escalator, left, right, through rows and rows of stalls. We eventually came to the supermarket - and he left me there. So, I went about and did a little shop, stocking up on supplies, and then... I couldn't find my way back. What a surprise! I was stuck in this nightmare of going round and round and I just could not find my way. There were no signs in English. I asked several shopkeepers (who ignored me) and a total of three security guards if they spoke English, and they did not.
I am normally a tough person, but after an hour and a half, I was on the verge of tears. I asked one more guard desperately if they spoke English and he actually got up and found me someone who did, who was my saviour. I was on the wrong level and he pointed me in the right direction. I eventually made it back to my room and I felt relieved. Then, I tried to connect to the Wi-Fi which did not work! Reza said he would message me the password through the email, which he did - however, I needed the internet to access it. The text that I got on my phone only showed the first two lines of the message and not the password.
I was so upset I literally screamed! I had to go back into that mall. I had to try to find an Indonesian SIM card to buy data. Two unsuccessful attempts and another hour later, I had a SIM card and data on my phone. It was around 7 P.M. and I managed to capture a glimpse of the burning red sun going down, before cooking instant noodles for dinner. I was sure I was not going out again. The way everyone stared at me and the lack of help really made me uncomfortable.
1. The following information might be the reasons why the writer couldn't easily find her way back to the apartment, except ....
a. She found that many people didn’t speak English.
b. She didn’t see any signs in English.
c. She got confused with the route she took to the supermarket.
d. She didn’t remember the route to get back to the apartment.
e. She lost her apartment key at the supermarket.
2. According to the passage, the correct statement about Reza is ....
a. He shopped with the writer in the supermarket.
b. He booked a room in the writer’s apartment.
c. He received a message about the Wi-Fi password.
d. He had a Wi-Fi modem in the room he rented.
e. He didn’t know how to go back to the apartment.
3. The writer did the following activities after she bought an Indonesian SIM card, except ....
a. She cooked instant noodles for dinner.
b. She possibly had dinner in her room.
c. She stayed in her room.
d. She watched the sunset.
e. She went back to the mall.</h2><br />

                            19. TEXT 1 A tablet computer, commonly shortened to tablet, is a mobile device, typically with a mobile operating system and touchscreen display processing circuitry, and rechargeable battery in a single thin, flat package. Tablets, being computers, do what other personal computers do, but lack some input/output (I/O) abilities that others have. Modern tablets largely resembles modern smartphones, the only difference being that tablets are relatively larger than smartphones, with screens 7 inches (18 cm) or larger, measured diagonally, and may not support access to a cellular network. The touchscreen display is operated by gestures executed by finger or digital pen (stylus), instead of the mouse, track-pad, and keyboard of larger computer. Two species of tablet, the slate and booklet, do not have physical keyboards and usually accept text and other input by use of a virtual keyboard shown on their touchscreen displays. To compensate for their lack of a physical keyboard, most tablets can connect to independent physical keyboards by wireless Bluetooth or USB.  TEXT 2 BALI: At a glimpse, Bintang Supermarket in Ubud looks just like other supermarkets across Bali. A banner announcing that it no longer provides plastic bags welcomes visitors upon entering the place-something that is now common practice on the island following a ban on single-use plastic bags issued by the administration earlier this year. However, something different can be seen on one of the supermarket’s fresh vegetable racks. Instead of plastic, the eggplants, water spinach, asparagus, and other fresh produce are wrapped in banana leaves and bamboo straps. “We have started to use banana leaves (for this purpose) around one month ago,”I Wayan Budiono, the assistant store manager, recently told the Jakarta Post. Budiono said the idea had come up after the place stopped providing single-use plastic bags to customers around two months ago. Not only were visitors supportive of the new policy, but they encouraged the supermarket to go one step further by minimizing the use of plastic as much as possible. Pay attention to the texts above! 1. Which is factual report of the text? 2. Show me which paragraphs that describe: a. subject of the report b. common description c. classification</h2><br />

                            20. Underline  the indirect objects in the following paragraphs!Morg was cross. She was more than cross, she was furious. She had been chosen to mind her little brother, again. Normally she quite liked him, as he stumbled after her on his short legs, babbling in a way that made her laugh, but today there was some-thing much more exciting happening. The men were preparing to go on a hunt. There hadn't been a hunt for months. First there was too much rain and then there was too much work with the harvest. But now the wheat was in and the grain was all stored in pits. The Druid was here, bringing blessings from the gods and medicines for the villagers. So the chief had decided that it was time. Outside the men were gathering and the Druid was chanting. Morg longed to be there.But Morg was not allowed to go. She wasn't even allowed to watch. Her brother was unwell. He had an evil spirit in his chest which was making him cough and cough. He had to stay warm, and to do that, he had to be in the hut. Therefore, while her mother was fetching water, Morg had to stay in the hut too. It was dark in the hut. A warm, rich, thick darkness, lit only by the glow from the fire which burnt in the middle of the room. Later, the fire would be built up so that flames would lick the round black cauldronand heat the stew for the evening meal, but for now turf had been laid on the logs. The fire would stay hot and alive, but would not need to be fed. Morg knew that fires were as ravenous as the wolves she heard howling in the woods at night.Morg could smell the fire and the smell was as familiar to her as the smell of her mother. She could sniff and tell in a moment whether the family were burning ash branches or hazel, hawthorn or coppiced elm. To Morg, it was the smell of home. The glow from the fire lit the face of the boy who lay next to it asleep on the blanket. Morg swept the floor around him savagely. Any crumbs or discarded meat would make food for the rats, and her mother hated rats. Morg decided that today she hated her mother. She knew her mother was anxious about the cough because her sister had coughed in the same way before she had died. That didn't stop Morg from muttering a curse against the unkind-ness that kept her inside the hut. As she said it, she wished she could swallow the words back, but it was too late. She looked around worriedly. Maybe nobody had heard. She chanted a good will incantation, and crossed her fingers.Outside, she heard a hunting horn, loud and sharp across the village. Morg sidled towards the doorway. She could see light through a gap in the planks, but that was not enough. She opened the door a crack. Maybe she could watch them from here? She might just be able to catch a glimpse of what was going on. But she couldn't see anything. The fence that kept in the pigs was blocking her view. She opened the door wider, and an icy blast of wind whipped it out of her hands. It banged crash against the side of the hut. Behind her the fire crackled into life and the baby opened his eyes. Morg did not notice. She fought for control of the door. She wedged it with a stone, so that it still looked closed at first glance. She slid out and across to the corner of the pig fence.</h2><br />

1.	Even the most seasoned and savvy clinician views lupus warily, considering it one of the most bewildering diseases in all of medicine. This situation should not be a surprise since the manifestations of lupus are dizzying in their variety and exasperating in their subtlety. Furthermore, although lupus has been at the heart of immunology research for decades, investigators have yet to figure out its basis. Lupus represents a blatant violat-ion of the most fundamental laws of the immune system. Nevertheless, the disturbances that dangerously turn self into non-self remain totally obscure.
2.	The image of lupus adds to the confusion, although lupus actually has two competing images. These images, despite their differences, represent lupus's trademarks, its 'brand identity' so to speak. Lupus got its name from the wolf; its usual symbol, however, is the butterfly. I doubt that there are any two species as unlike one another in attitude, color, and emotional resonance as the wolf and the butterfly. Even if a misnomer, the word schizophrenic rightly describes this fierce battle of identity.
3.	Branding a specific disease with the image of a creature comes with its hazards, and efforts to link a disease with a member of the animal kingdom are, in fact, unusual. Among the few associations that come to mind are icthyosis to describe skin that looks like fish scales; leonine facies, the lion-like visage of patients with lepromatous leprosy; and elephantiasis, the thickened skin and bulging extremities from filariasis.</h2><br />

Some people argue that right now is the time for digital painting. However, it is (2) ... that digital painting will not ever be the same as traditional painting. Moreover, digital painting hasn't been considered to be real art. That is there are some reasons why traditional painting is still important. At first, while a (3) ... captures just a momentary glimpse of humor, a painted (4)... is meant to convey a cumulative temper cumulative revealed over the course of a sitting. Not that the picture is not able to capture a set of feelings, but the painter's ability to capture it is directly related to his abilities with the brush and (5) Therefore, it means that the painter is subjected to, not only choose the topic of the artwork, but also decide how it will present itself, by "editing" it, so to speak, but doing it during the (6). process. May it be a portrait, a landscape, or a still life. Furthermore, there is, on a canvas, a (7).. 'handmade' feel.

Art suggests a way of being and invites us to live within its sight. It creates a place where we want to be, a place we inhabit (9)... while we strive to get there. And, regardless of the used technique, the viewer who looks at a work of art should look at it and feel some (10).... learning something from it. Even if one knows nothing about the style of the work itself - impressionism, realism, naturalism, etc., nor can name the techniques used, the (11)... itself and the sense of connection are still more important to the artist. If one is not able to identify, looking at the work, the battles fought by the artist during its construction, the (12)... of the skills and expertise of the artist is always well appreciated. Painting well is hard. And the traditionalist painter tries to paint well to better convey emotions to fellow humans. We cannot deny that is it much easier to identify with a (13)... work of art, that displays a realistic aspect of life, than with modern abstract work. It is a wildly accepted truth. So, if the human world needs connection beauty, and reflections, that makes traditional art very important. And (14)... realistically is very hard. Many people may not know how hard and demanding it is the training to become a realist painter, and then the life of a realist painter after. In past centuries there were no public academies, with students paying (15)..., but there were royal Academies, founded and maintained by the kings and courts. People learned the craft of painting either by being taught by masters in their studios or by being accepted into one of these academies, which was something very hard one needed to be good. And as there was no (16), the Painter was much more appreciated. People wanted good painters to be able to represent them in a picture for posterity or to (17)... stories, history, landscapes, or ideas, in beautiful ways. Most of the big names we hear today went through this process I am going through today, and had a similar lifestyle. The artists were considered (18)... in society, since the time of Academicism, and indeed, we are always studying, researching, and thinking. For these reasons, I understand that there is much to learn, and much to study as being a painter is a lifestyle. It requires sacrifice and effort. But I believe this kind of art is important to all (19)... Art is essential to the world. We must be humans, not (20)....

                            27. Lawang Sewu is an important place in Semarang and for many years tourists have been returning to Semarang only to have a glimpse of this amazing place here. They love coming here simply because of the distinctive Dutch symbolism and the immensely long corridors leading to the offices on the other side.
Lawang Sewu is famous for the Thousand Doors and windows and the fascinating long winding windows representing the Dutch Symbolism of the places.
The building has numerous long winding corridors which open out to the offices on one side of the office and the other end of the building on the other hand. It is a famous landmark on the region of Semarang.
The place was actually built as the main colonial office for the Dutch and was then taken over by Japanese government. This place was important because it was used for giving shelter to the soldiers here. The place was often considered to be haunted place as many people believed that the place was inhabited by spirits and ghosts.
However, later the place was converted into a heritage site and many come to visit the place during their holidays or vacation while coming to visit Semarang.

                            32. Underline  the indirect objects in the following paragraphs!Morg was cross. She was more than cross, she was furious. She had been chosen to mind her little brother, again. Normally she quite liked him, as he stumbled after her on his short legs, babbling in a way that made her laugh, but today there was some-thing much more exciting happening. The men were preparing to go on a hunt. There hadn't been a hunt for months. First there was too much rain and then there was too much work with the harvest. But now the wheat was in and the grain was all stored in pits. The Druid was here, bringing blessings from the gods and medicines for the villagers. So the chief had decided that it was time. Outside the men were gathering and the Druid was chanting. Morg longed to be there.But Morg was not allowed to go. She wasn't even allowed to watch. Her brother was unwell. He had an evil spirit in his chest which was making him cough and cough. He had to stay warm, and to do that, he had to be in the hut. Therefore, while her mother was fetching water, Morg had to stay in the hut too. It was dark in the hut. A warm, rich, thick darkness, lit only by the glow from the fire which burnt in the middle of the room. Later, the fire would be built up so that flames would lick the round black cauldronand heat the stew for the evening meal, but for now turf had been laid on the logs. The fire would stay hot and alive, but would not need to be fed. Morg knew that fires were as ravenous as the wolves she heard howling in the woods at night.Morg could smell the fire and the smell was as familiar to her as the smell of her mother. She could sniff and tell in a moment whether the family were burning ash branches or hazel, hawthorn or coppiced elm. To Morg, it was the smell of home. The glow from the fire lit the face of the boy who lay next to it asleep on the blanket. Morg swept the floor around him savagely. Any crumbs or discarded meat would make food for the rats, and her mother hated rats. Morg decided that today she hated her mother. She knew her mother was anxious about the cough because her sister had coughed in the same way before she had died. That didn't stop Morg from muttering a curse against the unkind-ness that kept her inside the hut. As she said it, she wished she could swallow the words back, but it was too late. She looked around worriedly. Maybe nobody had heard. She chanted a good will incantation, and crossed her fingers.Outside, she heard a hunting horn, loud and sharp across the village. Morg sidled towards the doorway. She could see light through a gap in the planks, but that was not enough. She opened the door a crack. Maybe she could watch them from here? She might just be able to catch a glimpse of what was going on. But she couldn't see anything. The fence that kept in the pigs was blocking her view. She opened the door wider, and an icy blast of wind whipped it out of her hands. It banged crash against the side of the hut. Behind her the fire crackled into life and the baby opened his eyes. Morg did not notice. She fought for control of the door. She wedged it with a stone, so that it still looked closed at first glance. She slid out and across to the corner of the pig fence</h2><br />

Normally she quite liked him, as he stumbled after her on his short legs, babbling in a way that made her laugh, but today there was some-thing much more exciting happening. The men were preparing to go on a hunt. There hadn't been a hunt for months. First there was too much rain and then there was too much work with the harvest. But now the wheat was in and the grain was all stored in pits. The Druid was here, bringing blessings from the gods and medicines for the villagers. So the chief had decided that it was time. Outside the men were gathering and the Druid was chanting. Morg longed to be there.  2. But Morg was not allowed to go. She wasn't even allowed to watch. Her brother was unwell. He had an evil spirit in his chest which was making him cough and cough. He had to stay warm, and to do that, he had to be in the hut. Therefore, while her mother was fetching water, Morg had to stay in the hut too. It was dark in the hut. A warm, rich, thick darkness, lit only by the glow from the fire which burnt in the middle of the room. Later, the fire would be built up so that flames would lick the round black cauldronand heat the stew for the evening meal, but for now turf had been laid on the logs. The fire would stay hot and alive, but would not need to be fed. Morg knew that fires were as ravenous as the wolves she heard howling in the woods at night.      3. Morg could smell the fire and the smell was as familiar to her as the smell of her mother. She could sniff and tell in a moment whether the family were burning ash branches or hazel, hawthorn or coppiced elm. To Morg, it was the smell of home. The glow from the fire lit the face of the boy who lay next to it asleep on the blanket. Morg swept the floor around him savagely. Any crumbs or discarded meat would make food for the rats, and her mother hated rats. Morg decided that today she hated her mother. She knew her mother was anxious about the cough because her sister had coughed in the same way before she had died. That didn't stop Morg from muttering a curse against the unkind-ness that kept her inside the hut. As she said it, she wished she could swallow the words back, but it was too late. She looked around worriedly. Maybe nobody had heard. She chanted a good will incantation, and crossed her fingers.  4. Outside, she heard a hunting horn, loud and sharp across the village. Morg sidled towards the doorway. She could see light through a gap in the planks, but that was not enough. She opened the door a crack. Maybe she could watch them from here? She might just be able to catch a glimpse of what was going on. But she couldn't see anything. The fence that kept in the pigs was blocking her view. She opened the door wider, and an icy blast of wind whipped it out of her hands. It banged crash against the side of the hut. Behind her the fire crackled into life and the baby opened his eyes. Morg did not notice. She fought for control of the door. She wedged it with a stone, so that it still looked closed at first glance. She slid out and across to the corner of the pig fence.</h2><br />
                        <p>Garisbawahi objek tidak langsung di paragraf berikut! 1. Morg adalah salib. Dia lebih dari sekadar salib, dia sangat marah. Dia telah dipilih untuk memikirkan adik laki-lakinya, lagi. Biasanya dia sangat menyukainya, karena dia menemukan kakinya yang pendek, mengoceh dengan cara yang membuatnya tertawa, tetapi hari ini ada sesuatu yang lebih menarik terjadi. Orang-orang itu bersiap untuk pergi berburu. Tidak ada perburuan selama berbulan-bulan. Pertama ada terlalu banyak hujan dan kemudian ada terlalu banyak pekerjaan dengan panen. Tapi sekarang gandum sudah masuk dan biji-bijian itu semuanya disimpan di dalam lubang. Druid ada di sini, membawa berkah dari para dewa dan obat-obatan untuk penduduk desa. Jadi, sang ketua memutuskan bahwa sudah waktunya. Di luar para pria sedang berkumpul dan Druid sedang melantunkan. Morg ingin berada di sana. 2. Tetapi Morg tidak diijinkan pergi. Dia bahkan tidak diizinkan untuk menonton. Kakaknya tidak sehat. Dia memiliki roh jahat di dadanya yang membuatnya batuk dan batuk. Dia harus tetap hangat, dan untuk melakukan itu, dia harus berada di dalam pondok. Karena itu, ketika ibunya mengambil air, Morg harus tinggal di pondok juga. Gelap di dalam pondok. Suatu kegelapan yang hangat, kaya, tebal, hanya diterangi oleh cahaya dari api yang membakar di tengah ruangan. Kemudian, api akan dibangun sehingga api akan menjilat kuali hitam bulat dan memanaskan rebusan untuk makan malam, tetapi untuk saat ini rumput telah diletakkan di kayu gelondongan. Api akan tetap panas dan hidup, tetapi tidak perlu diberi makan. Morg tahu bahwa kebakaran sama rakusnya dengan serigala yang dia dengar melolong di hutan pada malam hari. 3. Morg bisa mencium bau api dan baunya sama akrabnya dengan bau ibunya. Dia bisa mengendus dan mengatakan pada suatu saat apakah keluarga membakar abu cabang atau hazel, hawthorn atau elm berhurung. Untuk Morg, itu bau rumah. Cahaya dari api menyinari wajah bocah lelaki yang berbaring di sebelahnya tertidur di atas selimut. Morg menyapu lantai di sekitarnya dengan kejam. Setiap remah atau daging yang dibuang akan membuat makanan untuk tikus, dan ibunya membenci tikus. Morg memutuskan bahwa hari ini dia membenci ibunya. Dia tahu ibunya cemas tentang batuk karena kakaknya batuk dengan cara yang sama sebelum dia meninggal. Itu tidak menghentikan Morg dari menggumamkan kutukan melawan kejahatan yang membuatnya di dalam gubuk. Saat dia mengatakannya, dia berharap dia bisa menelan kembali kata-katanya, tetapi sudah terlambat. Dia melihat sekeliling dengan khawatir. Mungkin tidak ada yang mendengarnya. Dia melantunkan niat baik akan mantra, dan menyilangkan jari-jarinya. 4. Di luar, dia mendengar tanduk berburu, keras dan tajam melintasi desa. Morg beringsut menuju ambang pintu. Dia bisa melihat cahaya melalui celah di papan, tapi itu tidak cukup. Dia membuka pintu sedikit. Mungkin dia bisa menontonnya dari sini? Dia mungkin bisa melihat sekilas apa yang sedang terjadi. Tapi dia tidak bisa melihat apa pun. Pagar yang disimpan di babi menghalangi pandangannya. Dia membuka pintu lebih lebar, dan embusan angin dingin mencambuknya dari tangannya. Itu menabrak tabrakan di sisi gubuk. Di belakangnya api berderak menjadi hidup dan bayi itu membuka matanya. Morg tidak memperhatikan. Dia berjuang untuk mengendalikan pintu. Dia menjepitnya dengan batu, sehingga masih terlihat tertutup pada pandangan pertama. Dia meluncur keluar dan menyeberang ke pojok pagar babi.</p><br />

I had never been to the beach before, so I had been excited for weeks looking forward to our trip. The drive to the beach was a bit boring. The road was really windy, and my baby brother cried a lot, which was annoying. We stopped halfway to eat the chicken sandwiches that my Dad had made that morning. They were delicious! I caught my first glimpse of the beach when we drove over a big hill and I could just see the ocean water was sparkling in the distance. As we got closer, I was amazed by the deep blue water that stretched out for as far as I could see. I couldn't wait to finally get there. We pulled up at the beach and I jumped out of the car. I ran across the sand feeling the warmth on my bare feet. It was pretty, golden color and it felt so soft We set up umbrellas and chairs and then finally got to go swimming. The water was better than I had ever imagines. It was the perfect temperature, not too hot and not too cold. I loved the feeling of the gentle waves bumping against my legs. I spent all day swimming and playing in the sand with my baby brother. We made sandcastles and dug huge holes. My day at the beach was magical, and I can't wait to visit again! Questions 1.

                            39. READING SESSION Alexis de Tocqueville, the French political scientist, historian, philosopher and politician, is the most famoues for a four-volume book he wrote called “Democracy in America”. He came to America in 1831 to study the American form of democracy and what it might mean to the rest of the world. After a visit of only nine months, he wrote a remarkable book which is regarded as a classic. De Tocqueville had unusual power of observation. He described not only the democrativ system of government and how it operatedm but also its effect in how American think, feel, and act. Many scholats believe he had a deeper understanding of traditional American beliefs and values than anyone else who has written about the United States. What is so remarkable is that many of these traits which he observed nearly 200 years ago, are still visible and meaningful today. His observations are also important because the timing of his visit, the 1830s, was before America was industrialized. This was the era of the small farmer, the small businessman, and the settling of the western frontier. It was the period of history when the traditional values of the new country were newly established. In just a generation, some 40 years since the adoption of the US. Constitution, the new form of government had already produced a society of people with unique values. He was, however, a neutral observer and saw both the good and bad sides of there qualities.The first part of “Democracy in America” was written in 1831-32 and published in 1835. A highly positive and optimistic account of American government and society, the book was very well received. He attempted to get a glimpse of the essence of American society, all the while promoting his own philosophy: the equaling of the classes and the inevitable depth of aristocratic privilage. The rest of the book he labored on four years, and in 1840 the second part was published. This was substantially more pessimistic than the first, warning of the dangers despotism and governmental centralization, and applying his ideas and criticisms more directly to France. As a result, it was not received as well as the first part, except in England where it was acclaimed highly.(Adapted) 1.	What is the passage primarily about?a.	Alexis de Tocquevilleb.

                            40. Lawang Sewu is an important place in Semarang and for many years tourists have been returning to Semarang only to have a glimpse of this amazing place here. They love coming here simply because of the distinctive Dutch symbolism and the immensely long corridors leading to the offices on the other side.
Lawang Sewu is famous for the Thousand Doors and windows and the fascinating long winding windows representing the Dutch Symbolism of the places.
The building has numerous long winding corridors which open out to the offices on one side of the office and the other end of the building on the other hand. It is a famous landmark on the region of Semarang.
The place was actually built as the main colonial office for the Dutch and was then taken over by Japanese government. This place was important because it was used for giving shelter to the soldiers here. The place was often considered to be haunted place as many people believed that the place was inhabited by spirits and ghosts.
However, later the place was converted into a heritage site and many come to visit the place during their holidays or vacation while coming to visit Semarang.
