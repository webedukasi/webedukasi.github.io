The Wind and The Sun
The wind and the sun argued one day over which one was the stronger. Spotting a man man traveling on the road, they sported a challenge to see which one could remove the coat from the man's back the quickest.
The wind began. He blew strong gusts of air, so strong that the man could barely walk against them. But the man clutched his coat tight against him. The wind blew harder and longer, and the harder the wind blew, the tighter the man held his coat against him. The wind blew until he was exhausted, but he could not remove the coat from the man's back.
It was now the sun's turn. He gently sent his beams upon the traveler. The sun did very little, but quietly shone upon his head and back until the man became so warm that he took off his coat and headed for the nearest shade tree.</a>

Once upon a time there was an old man and his wife. One day he went to a bamboo grove to collect bamboo shoots, where he found a bamboo tree illuminated in the middle part. He wondered why and then became curious about what was inside. He carefully cut the bamboo and was astonished to find a pretty baby inside. He decided to pick her up and bring her back to his home. He consulted with his wife how to handle this baby, and they made up their minds to raise this baby as a gift from God.
After several years had passed, the baby grew up and was a young and beautiful lady in the town. Everyone knew her because she was graceful and beautiful. Hearing about her reputation, there were so many gentlemen who proposed marriage to her that the old parents were now very proud of her and tried to make her choose a candidates. She, however, declined any proposal. She became very sad and was crying everyday. The old parents couldn't understand why and couldn't get the daughter to answer.
On a full moon night, she decided to tell why she was crying . she told them that she hand to leave them and the house and return tp thr moon . the old perents were shocked and sad as well 
the time of her departure was getting nearer and she was frustrated for a long time . when the day finally arrived , the moon beams arrived to transport her back to thr moon . she said goodbye to her old parents and gave them an elixir of life as a goodbye  gift . the old parents lived a long life after that because of the gift</a>

                                            The Urban Legends of All Time
1. LA LLORONA
Yours truly grew up with this particular folktale, which originates in Mexico and is about a mother
named Maria (aka La Llorona) who threw her children into a river upon realizing that her
husband was unfaithful. She immediately regretted the impulsive act.
2. KUCHISAKE – ONNA / THE SLIT - MOUTHED WOMAN
Kuchisake-onna is a seemingly ordinary woman wearing a surgical mask, as though to protect
others from catching her cold. She appears before those walking alone at night, usually
children, and asks, ‘Am I beautiful?’
If you answer no, you are killed with the pair of scissors Kuchisake-onna carries. If you answer
yes, she takes off her mask to reveal her grotesque grin, a mouth that has been slit from ear to
ear. ‘How about now?’ she will ask; she will kill you if you say no, and cut you an identical smile
if you say yes. Rumor has it that a few answers will confuse Kuchisake-onna long enough for
you to escape: ‘You’re average,’. Kuchisake-onna was a woman disfigured by her husband
when he found out she was cheating. After he viciously cut her mouth, he asked her, ‘Who will
think you are beautiful now?’ 
3. BLOODY MARY
If you've ever walked into the bathroom, turned the lights on and off, and chanted "Bloody Mary,
Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary" in front of the mirror. Because apparently this is how you. And the
good news is that sometimes Mary's nice. The bad news is she often appears as a corpse
covered in blood.
4. TEKE – TEKE
Teke-Teke was a schoolgirl who tripped on some train tracks at a critical moment. She was cut
in half by the oncoming locomotive. Now, Teke-Teke is a vengeful spirit who crawls around on
her hands and elbows, the dragging sound of her torso along the ground making the teke-
teke sound which gives her the name. Teke-Teke wanders around at night, slicing her victims in
half with a scythe to mimic her own disfigurement. Once her victim comes close enough, she
surprises them and reveals herself. You can only escape Teke-Teke if you can outrun her, but
watch out – she’s extremely fast.
5. THE GOATMAN OF MARYLAND
The half-human and half-goat hybrid monster who trolls around Maryland. According to urban
legend, the axe-wielding Goatman used to be a scientist, until an experiment involving goats
turned him into a goat and he started murdering everyone with his axe. 
6. MOTHMAN
Most people are somewhat familiar with this buggy. Mothman is a man who is also a moth. He
lives in West Virginia, and first showed up during the '60s, when several folks claimed to see
him.
7. THE LICKER
The story goes that one night a girl and her dog were home alone, so she had her dog sleep
under her bed because she was scared. In the middle of the night, she woke up to the sound of
dripping coming from the bathroom, but she was too freaked out to get up and check what it
was. So naturally, she put her hand down underneath her bed for comfort and was reassured
when her dog gave her a lick. The next morning, she walked into the bathroom only to find her
dog slaughtered and strung up from the shower rod, his blood dripping onto the floor. On the
wall, someone had scrawled the message, "HUMANS CAN LICK TOO." It's unclear if The
Licker is still out there licking
8. SLENDER MAN
Basically, urban legend tells of a scary man with super long floppy arms who lives in the woods
and preys on children. This fake story made its way into urban legend so fast and so furiously
that kids started believing Slender Man was real. In fact, there have been multiple crimes
attributed to Slender Man—including the high-profile case of two girls who were accused of
stabbing their classmate in his name.
9. KILLER IN THE BACKSEAT
A woman is driving home alone at night. Suddenly, the car behind her starts driving erratically
and flashing its high beams. Understandably, she assumes she's being stalked and rushes
home—getting her car safely into the garage so that the car behind her can't follow her in. And it
turns out that there was a man in her backseat wielding a knife the whole time, and the driver
behind her had only been flashing his lights to try and deter the knife-wielding man.
10. AKA MANTO / RED CAPE
The frightening tale of Aka Manto says that the handsome spirit of a man wearing a mask waits
in the stalls of ladies’ washrooms, usually the last stall in a line. Once seated, the specter’s
voice will ask, ‘Do you want red paper, or blue?’ If you say red, you suffer a violent death. If you
answer blue, you are suffocated until you turn blue and die. Deviating from these answer by,
say, asking for ordinary white paper, will only have ghostly hands appearing out of nowhere –
sometimes right out of the toilet you’re sitting on – and drag you down to Hell. But, fear not: the
way to avoid any of these fates is to politely refuse anything he offers.

                                            The North Wind and The Sun The North Wind and the Sun had a quarrel about which of them was the stronger. While they were disputing with much heat and bluster, a Traveler passed along the road wrapped in a cloak. "Let us agree," said the Sun, "That he is the stronger who can strip that Traveler of his cloak." "Very well," growled the North Wind, and at once sent a cold, howling blast against the Traveler. With the first gust of wind the ends of the cloak whipped about the Traveler's body. But he immediately wrapped it closely around him, and the harder the Wind blew, the tighter he held it to him. The North Wind tore angrily at the cloak, but all his efforts were in vain. Then the Sun began to shine. At first his beams were gentle, and in the pleasant warmth after the bitter cold of the North Wind, the Traveler unfastened his cloak and let it hang loosely from his shoulders. The Sun's rays grew warmer. The man took off his cap and mopped his brow. At last he became so heated that he pulled off his cloak, and, to escape the blazing sunshine, threw himself down in the welcome shade of a tree by the roadside. Questions: 1. What kind of argument argued between the Sun and the North Wind? 2. What kind of challenge done by the Sun and the North Wind?3. What did the North Wind do to win the challenge? 4. Why did the man take off his cloak? 5.  What kind of lesson we can take from the story above? mohon bantuannya kak​</a>

                                            The following text is for questions 38 and 39.Lasers are devices that produce a narrow beamof extremely strong light. Lasers amplify light bycausing photons to be bounced back and forth ina substance, which can be solid, liquid or gas, whichadds extra energy. The result is that intense light isemitted in a very narrow beam. The intense beam oflight produced by laser can be used to produceimages for publicity or entertainment purposes.Lasers are also used to cut metal and forprecision cuts in operations. In CD players, laserlight is scanned across the CD's silvery surface,reading the audio and video information on the disc.They are also used in office printers and scanners,to display text and graphics. In engineering, theintense narrow beam of light is used to measure andalign roads and tunnels.Adopted from: Anonymous, Tell Me How?, London, ChancellorPress, 2011.38. How do lasers increase the light intensity?A. By absorbing less energy.B. By producing a single color of light.C. By amplifying the power of light beams.D. By emitting intense light in a very narrow beam.E. By causing photons to be bounced backand forth in a substance.39. “They are also used in office printers andscanners, (Paragraph 2) What does theyrefer to?A. Lasers.B. Printers.C. Scanners.D.

                                            How the process of occurrence of snowfall? To answer that, we can start the process of occurrence of snow. Starting from water vapor that gather in Earth’s atmosphere, the water vapor cools to the point of condensation (i.e. the temperature at which the gas turns into liquid or solid forms), then rotate to form clouds. At the beginning of the formation of clouds, its mass is much smaller than the mass of the air so that the clouds float in the air just like wooden beams which floats on the surface of the water. However, after the steam collection continues to grow and merge into the cloud, its mass also increases, resulting in a when air was not able to hold him again. The clouds broke and the water particles ever fallen to Earth.Water particles that fall it was pure water (not doped by other particles). Pure water does not freeze in temperatures of 0 degrees Celsius, because at the temperature of liquid phase changes to solid. To make pure water freezing temperature required is lower than 0 degrees Celsius. water evaporates when the temperature above 100 degrees Celsius because at 100 degrees Celsius is the change of phase from liquid to vapor. To speed up the change of the phase of a substance, usually added special substances, for example, salt is used to accelerate the phase of melting ice to water.Usually the air temperature just below the clouds is below 0 degrees Celsius (air temperature depending on the height above sea level). But, the low temperature alone is not enough to create snow. When particles of such pure water in contact with air, then the pure water of distortion by other particles. There are certain particles that function accelerates the freezing phase, so that pure water is rapidly becoming the ice crystals.Pollutant particles involved in this process is called nukleator, in addition to functioning as the freezing phase Accelerator, also the adhesive antaruap water. So the water particles (which are not pure anymore) joined together with other water particles to form larger crystals.If the air temperature is not to melt the ice crystals, ice crystals falling to the ground. And here’s the snow! If not, the ice crystals melt and get to the soil in the form of rain water.In many cases in the world, the process of the decline of the rain always starts with the snow some when she fell from the clouds, but then melted away when crossing the hot air. Sometimes, if the temperature is very low, the ice crystals can form small balls of ice and sleet. Bandung city included relatively frequently experience hail. So, this is why the snow was very hard down naturally in the tropical regions that have relatively high air temperatures than areas that are currently experiencing winter.Snow Crystal has a unique structure, no snow crystals that have the same shape in this world as our fingerprints. Imagine, the snow‘s been coming down since the Earth was created up to now, and none of the snow has the same crystal structure!The uniqueness of the snow is white in colour. If it’s snowing, the expanse of the Earth as white, clean, and seemed to be glowing. This is due to the Crystal structure of the snow allows snow to reflect all the colors to all directions in the same amount, then came the white color. The same phenomenon can also be seen when we see white sand, salt chunk, chunks of sugar, mist, cloud, and white paint.In addition, the decline in snow provide warmth. This can be understood from the concept of the effective temperature. Effective temperature is the temperature felt by our skin, is influenced by three physical quantities: the measured temperature (by the thermometer), the speed of movement of the air, and the air humidity. Effective temperature is typically used to determine the “comfort zone“. On the beach, the measured temperature can be high, but due to the high winds we still feel comfortable. By the time the snow fell heavy, humidity rises and this influenced the effective temperature so on one condition we feel warm.buatlah 10 soal pilihan ganda dari teks diatas ​</a>

Full ofsorrow, he lay on a pile of straw in the poorwoodchopper's hut. While he laid thinking, he noticed a spider spinning her web. The spider was trying to spin a thread from one beam to another. It was a long way between the beams, and Bruce saw how hard it was for her to do. "She can never doit," though the king.The little spider had tried it six times and had failed each time. "She is like me," thought the king. "I have tried six battles and failed. She has tried six times to reach the beam and failed." Then starting up fromthe straw, he cried, "I will hang my fate upon that little spider. If she swings the seventh time and fails then I will give up allfor lost. If she swings the seventh time andwins, I will call my men once more for a battle."The spider tried the seventh time, letting herself down upon her slender thread. She swung out bravely. "Look! Look!" shouted the king. "She has reached it. The thread hangs between the two beams. If the spider can do it, I can do it." Bruce got up from the straw with new strength and sent his men from village to village, calling the people to arms. The brave soldiers answered his call and came. Soon, his army was ready to fight, and when the king led them in a great battle against the enemy, this time, like the spider, Bruce won.

(to be) the traditional ancestral house, or Rumah adat of the Torajan people, in South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Tongkonan ……… (has/ have) and less decorated homes called ba Tongkonan are customarily built facing north-south. Dominating the entire structure is the saddleback roof with gables that are dramatically upswept. The internal space is small in comparison with the overwhelming roof structure that covers it. Interiors ……. (to be) typically cramped and dark with few windows, however, most of daily life is lived outside the homes, with interiors simply intended for sleeping, storage, meetings and occasionally protection.  A large tongkonan can take a crew of ten about three months to build and another month to carve and paint the outside walls. Bamboo scaffold is erected for the duration of the construction phase. Traditionally tongue and groove joinery has been used without the need for nails. A number of components are pre-fabricated with final assembly in-situ. Although built on a log cabin-style sub-structure, tongkonan are set on large vertical wooden piles with mortises cut into their ends to grasp the horizontal tie beams. The tops of the piles are notched for the longitudinal and transverse beams that support the upper structure. The remainder of the sub-structure is assembled in-situ. The transverse beams are fitted into the notched piles, and then notched to fit the longitudinal beams. Side panels, which are often decorated, are then formed on these main horizontal beams. The distinctive curved roof shape is obtained through a series of vertical hanging spars supporting upwardly angled beams. A vertical free-standing pole supports that portion of the ridge pole extending beyond the ridge purlin. Bamboo staves bound with rattan are assembled transversely in layers and tied longitudinally to the rafters forming the roof. The under roofing is of bamboo culm. Wooden boards laid over thick hardwood ……..(joist/ joists) form the floors. Nowadays, zinc roofing sheets and nails ………..(to be) increasingly used.  The tongkonan at Ke'te' Kesu' is reputed to be 500 years old; too old to trace a direct descendant from the founder to maintain the title that goes with the house. The buildings themselves, however, are constantly maintained and renewed, thus this age ………. (refer/ refers) to the length of time years for which that particular site has been used as a meeting place.​</a>

Once upon a time there was an old man and his wife. One day he went to a bamboo grove to collect bamboo shoots, where he found a bamboo tree illuminated in the middle part. He wondered why and then became curious about what was inside. He carefully cut the bamboo and was astonished to find a pretty baby inside. He decided to pick her up and bring her back to his home. He consulted with his wife how to handle this baby, and they made up their minds to raise this baby as a gift from God.
After several years had passed, the baby grew up and was a young and beautiful lady in the town. Everyone knew her because she was graceful and beautiful. Hearing about her reputation, there were so many gentlemen who proposed marriage to her that the old parents were now very proud of her and tried to make her choose a candidates. She, however, declined any proposal. She became very sad and was crying everyday. The old parents couldn't understand why and couldn't get the daughter to answer.
On a full moon night, she decided to tell why she was crying and to say she had to leave home and go back to the moon. She was frustrated for a long time because the time for her departure had come. The moon beams arrived to transport her back to the moon. She said good-bye to her old parents and gave them an elixir of life as a good-bye gift. The old parents lived a long life after that.</a>

As time went by, the spider was edified and received wisdom.All of a sudden, one day, the Buddha came to the temple. Inadvertently he saw the spider. He asked her:" You have lived here and thought for one thousand years, I want to ask you a question." The spider was glad that the Buddha would speak to her, so she promised to reply. The Buddha said: "What do you think is the most precious thing?" The spider answered:"I think the most precious thing is what I can't get and what I have lost." The Buddha left without a word.After a thousand years, the Buddha came and asked the spider the same question. The spider gave the same answer also. The Buddha said: "You can have a profound think, and I will come back to you some day."One day after a millennium, a sudden gale rolled a drop of dew up to the net. The dew was glistening and translucent, spider liked it very much and she was happy looking at the drop of dew everyday. But after a few days, the wind rolled the dew away from her. The spider felt lost. Then the Buddha came again. He asked:" Have you had a profound think about that question?"The spider thought of the dew, so she said :"What I can't get and have lost is the most precious thing in the world for me." Buddha said: "That being the case, I will let you become a person." So the spider become a beautiful girl of a rich family in the capital city. One day, the emperor rewarded the champion of the country who was named Dew. All of the girls in the capital were attracted to Dew. But Spider believed that Dew will fall in love with her because of the Buddha. But Dew had no impression of Spider, and didn't like Spider. Spider was sad. A few months later, the emperor announced that Dew would marry the Princess Wind and Spider would marry Prince Grass.She knew this and was extremely disappointed. She didn't have anything to eat for several days and was going to die. Then Prince Grass came hurriedly, and talked to the Spider. He said:" If you die, I will go with you!" He was ready to die.Just then, the Buddha came. He said to Spider:" Have you ever thought about who brings Dew to you? The Wind does this. And at last, the Wind will take it back. Dew belongs to Wind, not to you. But have you thought of Grass? He was the grass living in front of the temple. He was looking at you for three thousand years and loving you for three thousand years, but you never took any notice of him. Now, Spider, what do you think is the most precious in the world?"Spider understood the Buddha's meaning at once. She woke up, stopped Grass and gave Grass a deep hug. She said to the Buddha:" Now I know the most precious thing is the happiness I can have right now."Answer these questions according to the text!What is the topic of the text above?How many characters on the text above?

He asked her:" You have lived here and thought for one thousand years, I want to ask you a question." The spider was glad that the Buddha would speak to her, so she promised to reply. The Buddha said: "What do you think is the most precious thing?" The spider answered:"I think the most precious thing is what I can't get and what I have lost." The Buddha left without a word.After a thousand years, the Buddha came and asked the spider the same question. The spider gave the same answer also. The Buddha said: "You can have a profound think, and I will come back to you some day."One day after a millennium, a sudden gale rolled a drop of dew up to the net. The dew was glistening and translucent, spider liked it very much and she was happy looking at the drop of dew everyday. But after a few days, the wind rolled the dew away from her. The spider felt lost. Then the Buddha came again. He asked:" Have you had a profound think about that question?"The spider thought of the dew, so she said :"What I can't get and have lost is the most precious thing in the world for me." Buddha said: "That being the case, I will let you become a person." So the spider become a beautiful girl of a rich family in the capital city. One day, the emperor rewarded the champion of the country who was named Dew. All of the girls in the capital were attracted to Dew. But Spider believed that Dew will fall in love with her because of the Buddha. But Dew had no impression of Spider, and didn't like Spider. Spider was sad. A few months later, the emperor announced that Dew would marry the Princess Wind and Spider would marry Prince Grass.She knew this and was extremely disappointed. She didn't have anything to eat for several days and was going to die. Then Prince Grass came hurriedly, and talked to the Spider. He said:" If you die, I will go with you!" He was ready to die.Just then, the Buddha came. He said to Spider:" Have you ever thought about who brings Dew to you? The Wind does this. And at last, the Wind will take it back. Dew belongs to Wind, not to you. But have you thought of Grass? He was the grass living in front of the temple. He was looking at you for three thousand years and loving you for three thousand years, but you never took any notice of him. Now, Spider, what do you think is the most precious in the world?"Spider understood the Buddha's meaning at once. She woke up, stopped Grass and gave Grass a deep hug. She said to the Buddha:" Now I know the most precious thing is the happiness I can have right now."Answer these questions according to the text!What is the topic of the text above?How many characters on the text above? Mention it!What is the main idea of paragraph 2?What happen with the Buddha in paragraph 2?Why the spider feels sad?How Prince Grass feels about Spider?What is the moral value according to the text?​</a>

The Wind and The Sun
The wind and the sun argued one day over which one was the stronger. Spotting a man man traveling on the road, they sported a challenge to see which one could remove the coat from the man's back the quickest.
The wind began. He blew strong gusts of air, so strong that the man could barely walk against them. But the man clutched his coat tight against him. The wind blew harder and longer, and the harder the wind blew, the tighter the man held his coat against him. The wind blew until he was exhausted, but he could not remove the coat from the man's back.
It was now the sun's turn. He gently sent his beams upon the traveler. The sun did very little, but quietly shone upon his head and back until the man became so warm that he took off his coat and headed for the nearest shade tree.</h2><br />

Once upon a time there was an old man and his wife. One day he went to a bamboo grove to collect bamboo shoots, where he found a bamboo tree illuminated in the middle part. He wondered why and then became curious about what was inside. He carefully cut the bamboo and was astonished to find a pretty baby inside. He decided to pick her up and bring her back to his home. He consulted with his wife how to handle this baby, and they made up their minds to raise this baby as a gift from God.
After several years had passed, the baby grew up and was a young and beautiful lady in the town. Everyone knew her because she was graceful and beautiful. Hearing about her reputation, there were so many gentlemen who proposed marriage to her that the old parents were now very proud of her and tried to make her choose a candidates.

                            6. The Urban Legends of All Time
1. LA LLORONA
Yours truly grew up with this particular folktale, which originates in Mexico and is about a mother
named Maria (aka La Llorona) who threw her children into a river upon realizing that her
husband was unfaithful. She immediately regretted the impulsive act.
2. KUCHISAKE – ONNA / THE SLIT - MOUTHED WOMAN
Kuchisake-onna is a seemingly ordinary woman wearing a surgical mask, as though to protect
others from catching her cold. She appears before those walking alone at night, usually
children, and asks, ‘Am I beautiful?’
If you answer no, you are killed with the pair of scissors Kuchisake-onna carries. If you answer
yes, she takes off her mask to reveal her grotesque grin, a mouth that has been slit from ear to
ear. ‘How about now?’ she will ask; she will kill you if you say no, and cut you an identical smile
if you say yes. Rumor has it that a few answers will confuse Kuchisake-onna long enough for
you to escape: ‘You’re average,’. Kuchisake-onna was a woman disfigured by her husband
when he found out she was cheating. After he viciously cut her mouth, he asked her, ‘Who will
think you are beautiful now?’ 
3. BLOODY MARY
If you've ever walked into the bathroom, turned the lights on and off, and chanted "Bloody Mary,
Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary" in front of the mirror. Because apparently this is how you. And the
good news is that sometimes Mary's nice. The bad news is she often appears as a corpse
covered in blood.
4. TEKE – TEKE
Teke-Teke was a schoolgirl who tripped on some train tracks at a critical moment. She was cut
in half by the oncoming locomotive. Now, Teke-Teke is a vengeful spirit who crawls around on
her hands and elbows, the dragging sound of her torso along the ground making the teke-
teke sound which gives her the name. Teke-Teke wanders around at night, slicing her victims in
half with a scythe to mimic her own disfigurement. Once her victim comes close enough, she
surprises them and reveals herself. You can only escape Teke-Teke if you can outrun her, but
watch out – she’s extremely fast.
5. THE GOATMAN OF MARYLAND
The half-human and half-goat hybrid monster who trolls around Maryland. According to urban
legend, the axe-wielding Goatman used to be a scientist, until an experiment involving goats
turned him into a goat and he started murdering everyone with his axe. 
6. MOTHMAN
Most people are somewhat familiar with this buggy. Mothman is a man who is also a moth. He
lives in West Virginia, and first showed up during the '60s, when several folks claimed to see
him.
7. THE LICKER
The story goes that one night a girl and her dog were home alone, so she had her dog sleep
under her bed because she was scared. In the middle of the night, she woke up to the sound of
dripping coming from the bathroom, but she was too freaked out to get up and check what it
was. So naturally, she put her hand down underneath her bed for comfort and was reassured
when her dog gave her a lick. The next morning, she walked into the bathroom only to find her
dog slaughtered and strung up from the shower rod, his blood dripping onto the floor. On the
wall, someone had scrawled the message, "HUMANS CAN LICK TOO." It's unclear if The
Licker is still out there licking
8. SLENDER MAN
Basically, urban legend tells of a scary man with super long floppy arms who lives in the woods
and preys on children. This fake story made its way into urban legend so fast and so furiously
that kids started believing Slender Man was real. In fact, there have been multiple crimes
attributed to Slender Man—including the high-profile case of two girls who were accused of
stabbing their classmate in his name.
9. KILLER IN THE BACKSEAT
A woman is driving home alone at night. Suddenly, the car behind her starts driving erratically
and flashing its high beams. Understandably, she assumes she's being stalked and rushes
home—getting her car safely into the garage so that the car behind her can't follow her in. And it
turns out that there was a man in her backseat wielding a knife the whole time, and the driver
behind her had only been flashing his lights to try and deter the knife-wielding man.
10. AKA MANTO / RED CAPE
The frightening tale of Aka Manto says that the handsome spirit of a man wearing a mask waits
in the stalls of ladies’ washrooms, usually the last stall in a line. Once seated, the specter’s
voice will ask, ‘Do you want red paper, or blue?’ If you say red, you suffer a violent death. If you
answer blue, you are suffocated until you turn blue and die. Deviating from these answer by,
say, asking for ordinary white paper, will only have ghostly hands appearing out of nowhere –
sometimes right out of the toilet you’re sitting on – and drag you down to Hell. But, fear not: the
way to avoid any of these fates is to politely refuse anything he offers.

                            8. The North Wind and The Sun The North Wind and the Sun had a quarrel about which of them was the stronger. While they were disputing with much heat and bluster, a Traveler passed along the road wrapped in a cloak. "Let us agree," said the Sun, "That he is the stronger who can strip that Traveler of his cloak." "Very well," growled the North Wind, and at once sent a cold, howling blast against the Traveler. With the first gust of wind the ends of the cloak whipped about the Traveler's body. But he immediately wrapped it closely around him, and the harder the Wind blew, the tighter he held it to him. The North Wind tore angrily at the cloak, but all his efforts were in vain. Then the Sun began to shine. At first his beams were gentle, and in the pleasant warmth after the bitter cold of the North Wind, the Traveler unfastened his cloak and let it hang loosely from his shoulders. The Sun's rays grew warmer. The man took off his cap and mopped his brow. At last he became so heated that he pulled off his cloak, and, to escape the blazing sunshine, threw himself down in the welcome shade of a tree by the roadside. Questions: 1. What kind of argument argued between the Sun and the North Wind? 2. What kind of challenge done by the Sun and the North Wind?3. What did the North Wind do to win the challenge? 4. Why did the man take off his cloak? 5.  What kind of lesson we can take from the story above? mohon bantuannya kak​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p>The argument between the Sun and the North Wind was about which of them was stronger.The challenge was to see who could strip the Traveler of his cloak.The North Wind tried to win the challenge by sending a cold and howling blast against the Traveler, but all his efforts were in vain.The man took off his cloak because the Sun's rays grew warmer and he became too hot.The lesson we can take from the story is that sometimes, gentleness and persistence can be more effective than force and anger.<p></p><br />

                            10. The following text is for questions 38 and 39.Lasers are devices that produce a narrow beamof extremely strong light. Lasers amplify light bycausing photons to be bounced back and forth ina substance, which can be solid, liquid or gas, whichadds extra energy. The result is that intense light isemitted in a very narrow beam. The intense beam oflight produced by laser can be used to produceimages for publicity or entertainment purposes.Lasers are also used to cut metal and forprecision cuts in operations. In CD players, laserlight is scanned across the CD's silvery surface,reading the audio and video information on the disc.They are also used in office printers and scanners,to display text and graphics. In engineering, theintense narrow beam of light is used to measure andalign roads and tunnels.Adopted from: Anonymous, Tell Me How?, London, ChancellorPress, 2011.38. How do lasers increase the light intensity?A. By absorbing less energy.B. By producing a single color of light.C. By amplifying the power of light beams.D.

                            11. How the process of occurrence of snowfall? To answer that, we can start the process of occurrence of snow. Starting from water vapor that gather in Earth’s atmosphere, the water vapor cools to the point of condensation (i.e. the temperature at which the gas turns into liquid or solid forms), then rotate to form clouds. At the beginning of the formation of clouds, its mass is much smaller than the mass of the air so that the clouds float in the air just like wooden beams which floats on the surface of the water. However, after the steam collection continues to grow and merge into the cloud, its mass also increases, resulting in a when air was not able to hold him again. The clouds broke and the water particles ever fallen to Earth.Water particles that fall it was pure water (not doped by other particles). Pure water does not freeze in temperatures of 0 degrees Celsius, because at the temperature of liquid phase changes to solid. To make pure water freezing temperature required is lower than 0 degrees Celsius. water evaporates when the temperature above 100 degrees Celsius because at 100 degrees Celsius is the change of phase from liquid to vapor. To speed up the change of the phase of a substance, usually added special substances, for example, salt is used to accelerate the phase of melting ice to water.Usually the air temperature just below the clouds is below 0 degrees Celsius (air temperature depending on the height above sea level). But, the low temperature alone is not enough to create snow. When particles of such pure water in contact with air, then the pure water of distortion by other particles. There are certain particles that function accelerates the freezing phase, so that pure water is rapidly becoming the ice crystals.Pollutant particles involved in this process is called nukleator, in addition to functioning as the freezing phase Accelerator, also the adhesive antaruap water. So the water particles (which are not pure anymore) joined together with other water particles to form larger crystals.If the air temperature is not to melt the ice crystals, ice crystals falling to the ground. And here’s the snow! If not, the ice crystals melt and get to the soil in the form of rain water.In many cases in the world, the process of the decline of the rain always starts with the snow some when she fell from the clouds, but then melted away when crossing the hot air. Sometimes, if the temperature is very low, the ice crystals can form small balls of ice and sleet. Bandung city included relatively frequently experience hail. So, this is why the snow was very hard down naturally in the tropical regions that have relatively high air temperatures than areas that are currently experiencing winter.Snow Crystal has a unique structure, no snow crystals that have the same shape in this world as our fingerprints. Imagine, the snow‘s been coming down since the Earth was created up to now, and none of the snow has the same crystal structure!The uniqueness of the snow is white in colour. If it’s snowing, the expanse of the Earth as white, clean, and seemed to be glowing. This is due to the Crystal structure of the snow allows snow to reflect all the colors to all directions in the same amount, then came the white color. The same phenomenon can also be seen when we see white sand, salt chunk, chunks of sugar, mist, cloud, and white paint.In addition, the decline in snow provide warmth. This can be understood from the concept of the effective temperature. Effective temperature is the temperature felt by our skin, is influenced by three physical quantities: the measured temperature (by the thermometer), the speed of movement of the air, and the air humidity. Effective temperature is typically used to determine the “comfort zone“. On the beach, the measured temperature can be high, but due to the high winds we still feel comfortable. By the time the snow fell heavy, humidity rises and this influenced the effective temperature so on one condition we feel warm.buatlah 10 soal pilihan ganda dari teks diatas ​</h2><br />

                            18. Robert Bruce, King of Scotland, was hiding in a hut in the forest. His enemies were seeking him. Six times he had met them in battle, and six times he had failed. Bruce had given up all as lost. He was about to run away from Scotland, and to leave the country in the hands of his enemies. Full ofsorrow, he lay on a pile of straw in the poorwoodchopper's hut. While he laid thinking, he noticed a spider spinning her web. The spider was trying to spin a thread from one beam to another. It was a long way between the beams, and Bruce saw how hard it was for her to do. "She can never doit," though the king.The little spider had tried it six times and had failed each time. "She is like me," thought the king. "I have tried six battles and failed. She has tried six times to reach the beam and failed." Then starting up fromthe straw, he cried, "I will hang my fate upon that little spider. If she swings the seventh time and fails then I will give up allfor lost. If she swings the seventh time andwins, I will call my men once more for a battle."The spider tried the seventh time, letting herself down upon her slender thread. She swung out bravely. "Look! Look!" shouted the king. "She has reached it. The thread hangs between the two beams. If the spider can do it, I can do it." Bruce got up from the straw with new strength and sent his men from village to village, calling the people to arms. The brave soldiers answered his call and came. Soon, his army was ready to fight, and when the king led them in a great battle against the enemy, this time, like the spider, Bruce won.

Once upon a time there was an old man and his wife. One day he went to a bamboo grove to collect bamboo shoots, where he found a bamboo tree illuminated in the middle part. He wondered why and then became curious about what was inside. He carefully cut the bamboo and was astonished to find a pretty baby inside. He decided to pick her up and bring her back to his home. He consulted with his wife how to handle this baby, and they made up their minds to raise this baby as a gift from God.
After several years had passed, the baby grew up and was a young and beautiful lady in the town. Everyone knew her because she was graceful and beautiful. Hearing about her reputation, there were so many gentlemen who proposed marriage to her that the old parents were now very proud of her and tried to make her choose a candidates. She, however, declined any proposal. She became very sad and was crying everyday. The old parents couldn't understand why and couldn't get the daughter to answer.
On a full moon night, she decided to tell why she was crying and to say she had to leave home and go back to the moon. She was frustrated for a long time because the time for her departure had come. The moon beams arrived to transport her back to the moon. She said good-bye to her old parents and gave them an elixir of life as a good-bye gift. The old parents lived a long life after that.</h2><br />

Then, answer the questions according to the text!The Myth of SpiderOnce upon a time, there was a temple to which many people went to pray to the Buddha. A spider made a net on the beams. As time went by, the spider was edified and received wisdom.All of a sudden, one day, the Buddha came to the temple. Inadvertently he saw the spider. He asked her:" You have lived here and thought for one thousand years, I want to ask you a question." The spider was glad that the Buddha would speak to her, so she promised to reply. The Buddha said: "What do you think is the most precious thing?" The spider answered:"I think the most precious thing is what I can't get and what I have lost." The Buddha left without a word.After a thousand years, the Buddha came and asked the spider the same question. The spider gave the same answer also. The Buddha said: "You can have a profound think, and I will come back to you some day."One day after a millennium, a sudden gale rolled a drop of dew up to the net. The dew was glistening and translucent, spider liked it very much and she was happy looking at the drop of dew everyday. But after a few days, the wind rolled the dew away from her. The spider felt lost. Then the Buddha came again. He asked:" Have you had a profound think about that question?"The spider thought of the dew, so she said :"What I can't get and have lost is the most precious thing in the world for me." Buddha said: "That being the case, I will let you become a person." So the spider become a beautiful girl of a rich family in the capital city. One day, the emperor rewarded the champion of the country who was named Dew. All of the girls in the capital were attracted to Dew. But Spider believed that Dew will fall in love with her because of the Buddha. But Dew had no impression of Spider, and didn't like Spider. Spider was sad. A few months later, the emperor announced that Dew would marry the Princess Wind and Spider would marry Prince Grass.She knew this and was extremely disappointed. She didn't have anything to eat for several days and was going to die. Then Prince Grass came hurriedly, and talked to the Spider. He said:" If you die, I will go with you!" He was ready to die.Just then, the Buddha came. He said to Spider:" Have you ever thought about who brings Dew to you? The Wind does this. And at last, the Wind will take it back. Dew belongs to Wind, not to you. But have you thought of Grass? He was the grass living in front of the temple. He was looking at you for three thousand years and loving you for three thousand years, but you never took any notice of him. Now, Spider, what do you think is the most precious in the world?"Spider understood the Buddha's meaning at once. She woke up, stopped Grass and gave Grass a deep hug. She said to the Buddha:" Now I know the most precious thing is the happiness I can have right now."Answer these questions according to the text!What is the topic of the text above?How many characters on the text above?

Then, answer the questions according to the text!The Myth of SpiderOnce upon a time, there was a temple to which many people went to pray to the Buddha. A spider made a net on the beams. As time went by, the spider was edified and received wisdom.All of a sudden, one day, the Buddha came to the temple. Inadvertently he saw the spider. He asked her:" You have lived here and thought for one thousand years, I want to ask you a question." The spider was glad that the Buddha would speak to her, so she promised to reply. The Buddha said: "What do you think is the most precious thing?" The spider answered:"I think the most precious thing is what I can't get and what I have lost." The Buddha left without a word.After a thousand years, the Buddha came and asked the spider the same question. The spider gave the same answer also. The Buddha said: "You can have a profound think, and I will come back to you some day."One day after a millennium, a sudden gale rolled a drop of dew up to the net. The dew was glistening and translucent, spider liked it very much and she was happy looking at the drop of dew everyday. But after a few days, the wind rolled the dew away from her. The spider felt lost. Then the Buddha came again. He asked:" Have you had a profound think about that question?"The spider thought of the dew, so she said :"What I can't get and have lost is the most precious thing in the world for me." Buddha said: "That being the case, I will let you become a person." So the spider become a beautiful girl of a rich family in the capital city. One day, the emperor rewarded the champion of the country who was named Dew. All of the girls in the capital were attracted to Dew. But Spider believed that Dew will fall in love with her because of the Buddha. But Dew had no impression of Spider, and didn't like Spider. Spider was sad. A few months later, the emperor announced that Dew would marry the Princess Wind and Spider would marry Prince Grass.She knew this and was extremely disappointed. She didn't have anything to eat for several days and was going to die. Then Prince Grass came hurriedly, and talked to the Spider. He said:" If you die, I will go with you!" He was ready to die.Just then, the Buddha came. He said to Spider:" Have you ever thought about who brings Dew to you? The Wind does this. And at last, the Wind will take it back. Dew belongs to Wind, not to you. But have you thought of Grass? He was the grass living in front of the temple. He was looking at you for three thousand years and loving you for three thousand years, but you never took any notice of him. Now, Spider, what do you think is the most precious in the world?"Spider understood the Buddha's meaning at once. She woke up, stopped Grass and gave Grass a deep hug. She said to the Buddha:" Now I know the most precious thing is the happiness I can have right now."Answer these questions according to the text!What is the topic of the text above?How many characters on the text above? Mention it!What is the main idea of paragraph 2?What happen with the Buddha in paragraph 2?Why the spider feels sad?How Prince Grass feels about Spider?What is the moral value according to the text?​</h2><br />
