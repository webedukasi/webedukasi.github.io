Then, Prabu took out a necklace which was made from gold and jewel. "My beloved daughter, today I give you this neckiace. Please wear it," said Prabu. "I don't want to wear it! It's ugly!" yelled the princess. Then, she chucked the necklace. The attractive necklace was broken. The gold and jewels were dispersing out on the floor. Everybody couldn't say anything. They had not ever thought that their beloved princess would do that disrespectful thing. In their silence, the people saw the queen bawling. Every woman felt miserable and started bawling, too. Then, everyone was bawling. Then, there was a miracle. The earth was bawling. Abruptly, from the below ground, a spring emerged. It made a pool of water. Soon, the location became a big lagoon. The lagoon finally sank the kingdom. Nowadays, people called the lagoon "Telaga Warna", It means "Lake of Color". On a bright day, the lagoon is full of hue. These colors come from shaded plantation, plants, blossoms, and atmosphere around the lake. But some people said that the colors are from the princess necklace, which dispersed at the bottom of the lake. 1. What is the story about?2. How was the king like? 3. How was the princess like? 4.

It contains about half facts and half opinions.
Text baca: Ever wondered where chocolate comes from? Well, surprisingly, it grows on trees! It all starts with a small tropical tree, the Theobroma cacao, usually just called ‘cacao’. (Theobroma is Greek for ‘food of the gods’.) Cacao is native to Central and South America, but it is grown commercially throughout the tropics. About 70% of the world’s cacao is grown in Africa.
A cacao tree can produce close to two thousand pods per year. The ridged, rugbyball-shaped pod, or fruit, of the cacao grows from the branches and, oddly, straight out of the trunk. The pods, which mature throughout the year, encase a sticky, white pulp and about thirty or forty seeds. The seeds, at this point, are incredibly bitter – not at all like the chocolate that comes from them. It’s actually the perfect design because the fruit attracts forest animals, such as monkeys, which eat the fruit but cast the seeds aside, dispersing them and allowing new trees to grow.
So what must be done to the seeds to make them taste better? First, the pods must be harvested. Once they are collected, the workers open the pods by hand, taking care not to damage the beans inside. The beans are removed and next comes one of the most important steps in the process – fermentation. The beans are placed in earthen pits or wooden bins and covered with banana leaves, then left to ferment. The heat of fermentation changes the bitter flavours in the bean into something more edible, more chocolatey.
Once they have fermented, the beans are dried in the sun for about a week, during which time the flavour continues to develop. Finally, the beans are ready to be shipped to a factory, where they are turned into chocolate.</a>

                                            In 1920, after some thirty-nine years of problems with disease, high costs, and politics, the Panama Canal was officially opened, finally linking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans by allowing ships to pass through the fifty-mile canal zone instead of traveling some seven thousand miles around Cape Horn. It takes a ship approximately eight hours to complete the grip through the canal and costs an average of fifteen thousand dollars, one tenth of what it would cost an average ship to round the Horn. More than fifteen thousand ships pass through its lock each year.The French initiated the project but sold their rights to the United States, which actually began the construction of the project. The latter will control it until the end of the twentieth century when Panama takes over its duties.Questions:The word “linking” in 1st sentence of 1st paragraph is closest in meaning toa.separatingb.detachingc.controllingd.dispersinge.joining​</a>

                                            Reading Comprehension – Around the world, capital cities are disgorging bureaucratsAround the world, capital cities are disgorging bureaucrats. In the post-colonial fervour of the 20th century, coastal capitals picked by trade-focused empires were spurned for “regionally neutral” new ones . . . . But decamping wholesale is costly and unpopular; governments these days prefer piecemeal dispersal. The trend reflects how the world has changed. In past eras, when information travelled at a snail’s pace, civil servants had to cluster together. But now desk-workers can ping emails and video-chat around the world. Travel for face-to-face meetings may be unavoidable, but transport links, too, have improved.Proponents of moving civil servants around promise countless benefits. It disperses the risk that a terrorist attack or natural disaster will cripple an entire government. Wonks in the sticks will be inspired by new ideas that walled-off capitals cannot conjure up. Autonomous regulators perform best far from the pressure and lobbying of the big city. Some even hail a cure for ascendant cynicism and populism. The unloved bureaucrats of faraway capitals will become as popular as firefighters once they mix with regular folk.Beyond these sunny visions, dispersing central-government functions usually has three specific aims: to improve the lives of both civil servants and those living in clogged capitals; to save money; and to redress regional imbalances. The trouble is that these goals are not always realised.The first aim—improving living conditions—has a long pedigree. After the second world war Britain moved thousands of civil servants to “agreeable English country towns” as London was rebuilt. But swapping the capital for somewhere smaller is not always agreeable. Attrition rates can exceed 80%. . . . The second reason to pack bureaucrats off is to save money. Office space costs far more in capitals. . . . Agencies that are moved elsewhere can often recruit better workers on lower salaries than in capitals, where well-paying multinationals mop up talent.The third reason to shift is to rebalance regional inequality. . . . Norway treats federal jobs as a resource every region deserves to enjoy, like profits from oil. Where government jobs go, private ones follow. . . . Sometimes the aim is to fulfil the potential of a country’s second-tier cities. Unlike poor, remote places, bigger cities can make the most of relocated government agencies, linking them to local universities and businesses and supplying a better-educated workforce. The decision in 1946 to set up America’s Centres for Disease Control in Atlanta rather than Washington, D.C., has transformed the city into a hub for health-sector research and business.The dilemma is obvious. Pick small, poor towns, and areas of high unemployment get new jobs, but it is hard to attract the most qualified workers; opt for larger cities with infrastructure and better-qualified residents, and the country’s most deprived areas see little benefit. . . .Others contend that decentralisation begets corruption by making government agencies less accountable. . . . A study in America found that state-government corruption is worse when the state capital is isolated—journalists, who tend to live in the bigger cities, become less watchful of those in power.Task 1.

The Battle of Uhud
The battle of Uhud was a battle between Muslims of Medina and Quraish Meccan enemies and was fought on Saturday, March 19, 625 at valley in front of Mount Uhud.
The Meccans desired to avenge their losses at Badr and strike back Muhammad and his followers. The Muslims readied for war soon afterwards and the two armies fought on the slopes and plains of mount Uhud.
Whilst outnumbered, the moslems gained the early initiative and forced the Meccan lines back, thus leaving much of the Meccan camp unprotected. When the battle looked to be only one step away from a decisive Muslim victory, a serious mistake was committed by a part of Muslim army, which altered the outcome of the battle. A breach of prophet Muhmmad’s orders by the Muslim archers, who left their assigned posts to despoil the Meccan camp, allowed a surprise attack from the Meccan cavalry, led by Meccan war veteran Khalid bin Walid, which brought chaos to the Muslim ranks. Many Muslims were killed, and Muhammad himself was badly injured. The Muslims had to withdraw up the slopes of Uhud. The Meccans did not pursue the Muslim further, but marched back to Mecca declaring victory.
One of Islam’s heroes is Mus’ab bin Umair (may Allah pleased with him) held the flag of Islam. When the Muslims on meeting defeat were dispersing in confusion, he held the flag and stood at his post like a rock. An enemy came and cut his hand with a sword, so that the flag might fall and the defeat might be accomplished. He at once took the flag in the other hand. Then, the enemy cut the other hand also. He held the flag to his bosom with help of his bleeding arms. The enemy at last pierced his body with an arrow. He fell and dead. Another Muslim ran and took over the flag. At the time of his burial, he had only one sheet to cover his body. This sheet was too short for his size. When it was drawn to cover the head, the feet would be exposed. And when it was drawn to cover the feet, the head would become uncovered. The prophet said “Cover his head with the sheet, and cover his feet with the ‘Azkhar’ leaves.”
In conclusion the end of the battle was in fact glorious and victorious for the Muslims had been successful in protecting the Prophet Muhammad and they knew they had the advantage over the kuffar when it came to Allah. For the killed Muslims would be promised Jannah and the kuffar would be promised the fire of Jahannam.
They had learned from their mistakes and they now knew not to make the same mistakes again

                        (topic sentence):
Early childhood education programs such as Head Start provide cognitive benefits well beyond preschool. 

(supporting sentence):
Recent studies that compare student test scores show that children who are exposed to structured learning activities outside the home environment are better able to adapt to formalized instruction in grades kindergarten through third grade than children who remain at home. This is particularly true among children from low-income families and children whose parents have a limited proficiency in English. Children living in states that do not provide early childhood programs, on the other hand, lag behind their peers. 

(summarize sentence):
State and local governments must continue to bridge the achievement gap so that students may reach their full potential at an early age.<br />

Pertanyaan:
Tick the best description of the text Chocolate.
It contains only facts. 
It contains mostly facts.
It contains mostly opinions.
It contains about half facts and half opinions.
Text baca: Ever wondered where chocolate comes from? Well, surprisingly, it grows on trees! It all starts with a small tropical tree, the Theobroma cacao, usually just called ‘cacao’. (Theobroma is Greek for ‘food of the gods’.) Cacao is native to Central and South America, but it is grown commercially throughout the tropics. About 70% of the world’s cacao is grown in Africa.
A cacao tree can produce close to two thousand pods per year. The ridged, rugbyball-shaped pod, or fruit, of the cacao grows from the branches and, oddly, straight out of the trunk. The pods, which mature throughout the year, encase a sticky, white pulp and about thirty or forty seeds. The seeds, at this point, are incredibly bitter – not at all like the chocolate that comes from them. It’s actually the perfect design because the fruit attracts forest animals, such as monkeys, which eat the fruit but cast the seeds aside, dispersing them and allowing new trees to grow.
So what must be done to the seeds to make them taste better? First, the pods must be harvested. Once they are collected, the workers open the pods by hand, taking care not to damage the beans inside. The beans are removed and next comes one of the most important steps in the process – fermentation. The beans are placed in earthen pits or wooden bins and covered with banana leaves, then left to ferment. The heat of fermentation changes the bitter flavours in the bean into something more edible, more chocolatey.
Once they have fermented, the beans are dried in the sun for about a week, during which time the flavour continues to develop. Finally, the beans are ready to be shipped to a factory, where they are turned into chocolate.</h2><br />

                            19. In 1920, after some thirty-nine years of problems with disease, high costs, and politics, the Panama Canal was officially opened, finally linking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans by allowing ships to pass through the fifty-mile canal zone instead of traveling some seven thousand miles around Cape Horn. It takes a ship approximately eight hours to complete the grip through the canal and costs an average of fifteen thousand dollars, one tenth of what it would cost an average ship to round the Horn. More than fifteen thousand ships pass through its lock each year.The French initiated the project but sold their rights to the United States, which actually began the construction of the project. The latter will control it until the end of the twentieth century when Panama takes over its duties.Questions:The word “linking” in 1st sentence of 1st paragraph is closest in meaning toa.separatingb.detachingc.controllingd.dispersinge.joining​</h2><br />

                            20. Reading Comprehension – Around the world, capital cities are disgorging bureaucratsAround the world, capital cities are disgorging bureaucrats. In the post-colonial fervour of the 20th century, coastal capitals picked by trade-focused empires were spurned for “regionally neutral” new ones . . . . But decamping wholesale is costly and unpopular; governments these days prefer piecemeal dispersal. The trend reflects how the world has changed. In past eras, when information travelled at a snail’s pace, civil servants had to cluster together. But now desk-workers can ping emails and video-chat around the world. Travel for face-to-face meetings may be unavoidable, but transport links, too, have improved.Proponents of moving civil servants around promise countless benefits. It disperses the risk that a terrorist attack or natural disaster will cripple an entire government. Wonks in the sticks will be inspired by new ideas that walled-off capitals cannot conjure up. Autonomous regulators perform best far from the pressure and lobbying of the big city. Some even hail a cure for ascendant cynicism and populism. The unloved bureaucrats of faraway capitals will become as popular as firefighters once they mix with regular folk.Beyond these sunny visions, dispersing central-government functions usually has three specific aims: to improve the lives of both civil servants and those living in clogged capitals; to save money; and to redress regional imbalances. The trouble is that these goals are not always realised.The first aim—improving living conditions—has a long pedigree. After the second world war Britain moved thousands of civil servants to “agreeable English country towns” as London was rebuilt. But swapping the capital for somewhere smaller is not always agreeable. Attrition rates can exceed 80%. . . . The second reason to pack bureaucrats off is to save money. Office space costs far more in capitals. . . . Agencies that are moved elsewhere can often recruit better workers on lower salaries than in capitals, where well-paying multinationals mop up talent.The third reason to shift is to rebalance regional inequality. . . . Norway treats federal jobs as a resource every region deserves to enjoy, like profits from oil. Where government jobs go, private ones follow. . . . Sometimes the aim is to fulfil the potential of a country’s second-tier cities. Unlike poor, remote places, bigger cities can make the most of relocated government agencies, linking them to local universities and businesses and supplying a better-educated workforce. The decision in 1946 to set up America’s Centres for Disease Control in Atlanta rather than Washington, D.C., has transformed the city into a hub for health-sector research and business.The dilemma is obvious. Pick small, poor towns, and areas of high unemployment get new jobs, but it is hard to attract the most qualified workers; opt for larger cities with infrastructure and better-qualified residents, and the country’s most deprived areas see little benefit. . . .Others contend that decentralisation begets corruption by making government agencies less accountable. . . . A study in America found that state-government corruption is worse when the state capital is isolated—journalists, who tend to live in the bigger cities, become less watchful of those in power.Task 1.

The Battle of Uhud
The battle of Uhud was a battle between Muslims of Medina and Quraish Meccan enemies and was fought on Saturday, March 19, 625 at valley in front of Mount Uhud.
The Meccans desired to avenge their losses at Badr and strike back Muhammad and his followers. The Muslims readied for war soon afterwards and the two armies fought on the slopes and plains of mount Uhud.
Whilst outnumbered, the moslems gained the early initiative and forced the Meccan lines back, thus leaving much of the Meccan camp unprotected. When the battle looked to be only one step away from a decisive Muslim victory, a serious mistake was committed by a part of Muslim army, which altered the outcome of the battle. A breach of prophet Muhmmad’s orders by the Muslim archers, who left their assigned posts to despoil the Meccan camp, allowed a surprise attack from the Meccan cavalry, led by Meccan war veteran Khalid bin Walid, which brought chaos to the Muslim ranks. Many Muslims were killed, and Muhammad himself was badly injured. The Muslims had to withdraw up the slopes of Uhud. The Meccans did not pursue the Muslim further, but marched back to Mecca declaring victory.
One of Islam’s heroes is Mus’ab bin Umair (may Allah pleased with him) held the flag of Islam. When the Muslims on meeting defeat were dispersing in confusion, he held the flag and stood at his post like a rock. An enemy came and cut his hand with a sword, so that the flag might fall and the defeat might be accomplished. He at once took the flag in the other hand. Then, the enemy cut the other hand also. He held the flag to his bosom with help of his bleeding arms. The enemy at last pierced his body with an arrow. He fell and dead. Another Muslim ran and took over the flag. At the time of his burial, he had only one sheet to cover his body. This sheet was too short for his size. When it was drawn to cover the head, the feet would be exposed. And when it was drawn to cover the feet, the head would become uncovered. The prophet said “Cover his head with the sheet, and cover his feet with the ‘Azkhar’ leaves.”
In conclusion the end of the battle was in fact glorious and victorious for the Muslims had been successful in protecting the Prophet Muhammad and they knew they had the advantage over the kuffar when it came to Allah. For the killed Muslims would be promised Jannah and the kuffar would be promised the fire of Jahannam.
They had learned from their mistakes and they now knew not to make the same mistakes again
