                                            The human brain, with an average weight of 1.4 kilograms, is the control center of the body. It receives information from the senses, processes the information, and rapidly sends out responses; it also stores the information that is the source of human thoughts and feelings. Each of the three main parts of the brain-the cerebrum, the cerebellum, and the brain stem-has its own role in carrying out these functions. The cerebrum is by far the largest of the three parts, taking up 85 percent of the brain by weight. The outside layer of the cerebrum, the cerebral cortex, is a grooved and bumpy surface covering the nerve cells beneath. The various sections of the cerebrum are the sensory cortex, which is responsible for receiving and decoding sensory massages from throughout the body; the motor cortex, which sends action instructions to the skeletal muscles; and the association cortex, which receives, monitors, and processes information. It is in the association cortex that the processes that allow humans to think take place.The cerebellum, located below the cerebrum in the back part of the skull, is made of masses of bunched up nerve cells. It is the cerebellum that controls human balance, coordination, and posture.The brain stem, which connects the cerebrum and the spinal cord, controls various body processes such as breathing and heartbeat. It is the major motor and sensory pathway connecting the body and the cerebrum.22.What is the author’s main purpose?answer choices(A) To describe the functions of the parts of the brain(B) To explain how the brain processes information(C) To demonstrate the physical composition of the brain(D) To give examples of human body function23.The word “stores” in paragraph 1 is closest in meaning to?answer choices(A) Shops(B) Processes(C) Releases(D) Stockpiles24.The passage states that the most massive part of the brain is the?answer choices(A) Cerebrum(B) Cerebellum(C) Cerebral cortex(D) Brain stem25.The “cerebral cortex” in paragraph 1 is?answer choices(A) A layer of the brain beneath the cerebrum(B) A layer of nerve cells in the brain(C) A part of the brain that makes up 85 percent of the brain(D) A ridged layer covering the cerebrum in the brain26.

There are six emergency exits on this aircraft. Take a moment to locate the exit closest to you. Note that the nearest exit may be behind you. Count the number of rows to this exit. Should the cabin experience sudden pressure loss, stay calm and listen for instructions from the cabin crew. Oxygen masks will drop down from above your seat. Place the mask over your mouth and nose, like this. Pull the strap to tighten it. If you are traveling with children, make sure that your own mask is on first before helping your children. In the unlikely event of an emergency landing and evacuation, leave your carry-on items behind. Life rafts are located below your seats and emergency lighting will lead you to your closest exit and slide. We ask that you make sure that all carry-on luggage is stowed away safely during the flight. While we wait for takeoff, please take a moment to review the safety data card in the seat pocket in front of you.5.What does the text talk about?a. An emergency procedureb. An emergency lightingc.

With computer connected to internet, students can learnEnglish online. They can make reports easily by using wordprocessing software.

By connecting to internet,they can easily surf and find any materials related to their lessons and assignments. They haveunlimited resources from all over the worlds. Online libraries are open. A lot of books are free todownload and read online. Finding friends from related field of study is not difficult anymore. Theycan work together to boost their best achievement. What more benefit is they can do all of thatjust by sitting on the a chair of their rooms. What amazing world it is, isn't?Although a computer has many benefits, it should be considered deeply. A computer certainlydoes not promote students to do and move more. A computes make students have less physicalactivities. Even not few of them forget to have lunch while they are playing certain game. Theyjust sit in front of monitors. They are caught up in the mystique of the smart machines. In short,students who usually work with computers tend to have a few physical activities and exercisesSo what should students do? Should they avoid using computers? Of course "No". Computerwill make even greater benefits if physical activities are also promoted to done by the students.Questions:1. What does the text tells us about?2. What the students can learn with computer connected to internet?3. What students can do to finish their assignments by connecting internet?4. Did computer also give negative impacts for students?5. Should they avoid using computers? Why?​</a>

What is this article mainly about?A. the passage of a new billB. a breakthrough in researchC. an invasion of foreignersD. the weakening of a recent law112. The members of the Council are probably experts in which of these fields?A. NutritionB. AdvertisingC. LawD. Linguistics113. How will the owners of restaurants in France be affected by this ruling?A. They can now serve hamburgers with cheese.B. They must now use only French words on menus.C. They may now use English words in advertisements.D. They no longer must serve only French foods.114. Why did the council make this decision about the law?A. Because so many people objected to the lawBecause the law was believed to violate the constitutionC. Because the restaurant owners were unhappy with the lawD. Because the law did not have its intended effect​</a>

Through his skills in deciding the starters, knowing his team's strengths android weaknesses,as well as his opponent's strengths and weaknesses, he managed to formulate an accurate strategy. Everyone admits his intelligence!In every game, he monitors the players whether they apply he strategy that has been conveyed, accurately. He always gives them instructions and encouragement with his gestures and yell. Not a single player escapes from his eye sight. On the other hand, he is also wary of his opponent's tactics, so he can give the right instructions to his players. They always listen to him.It turns out that not only the players' skills on the field, but also their characters have been developed by Coach Bima Sakti. He always tells his players to always fight beyond their limits, be tough, have strong self discipline, and have precise targets. Besides, they must remain humble, friendly, and painstaking.Bima Sakti was born in Balikpapan, East Kalimantan, on January 23, 1976. Before becoming a coach, Bima Sakti was one of the mainstay midfielders of the Indonesian national team. The 46-year-old man is known for his strong stamina and hard kick when he was active as a soccer player.10.What is the main idea of paragraph 1? a.

                            4. The human brain, with an average weight of 1.4 kilograms, is the control center of the body. It receives information from the senses, processes the information, and rapidly sends out responses; it also stores the information that is the source of human thoughts and feelings. Each of the three main parts of the brain-the cerebrum, the cerebellum, and the brain stem-has its own role in carrying out these functions. The cerebrum is by far the largest of the three parts, taking up 85 percent of the brain by weight. The outside layer of the cerebrum, the cerebral cortex, is a grooved and bumpy surface covering the nerve cells beneath. The various sections of the cerebrum are the sensory cortex, which is responsible for receiving and decoding sensory massages from throughout the body; the motor cortex, which sends action instructions to the skeletal muscles; and the association cortex, which receives, monitors, and processes information. It is in the association cortex that the processes that allow humans to think take place.The cerebellum, located below the cerebrum in the back part of the skull, is made of masses of bunched up nerve cells. It is the cerebellum that controls human balance, coordination, and posture.The brain stem, which connects the cerebrum and the spinal cord, controls various body processes such as breathing and heartbeat.

There are six emergency exits on this aircraft. Take a moment to locate the exit closest to you. Note that the nearest exit may be behind you. Count the number of rows to this exit. Should the cabin experience sudden pressure loss, stay calm and listen for instructions from the cabin crew. Oxygen masks will drop down from above your seat. Place the mask over your mouth and nose, like this. Pull the strap to tighten it. If you are traveling with children, make sure that your own mask is on first before helping your children. In the unlikely event of an emergency landing and evacuation, leave your carry-on items behind. Life rafts are located below your seats and emergency lighting will lead you to your closest exit and slide. We ask that you make sure that all carry-on luggage is stowed away safely during the flight. While we wait for takeoff, please take a moment to review the safety data card in the seat pocket in front of you.5.What does the text talk about?a. An emergency procedureb. An emergency lightingc.

Jawaban yang benar adalah (B) are doing.<br />Pembahasan:<br />Kalimat tersebut berbicara tentang aktivitas yang sedang berlangsung saat ini ("Right now"). Oleh karena itu, kita memerlukan bentuk Present Continuous Tense. Pilihan (B) "are doing" adalah bentuk yang sesuai untuk menggambarkan bahwa para siswa sedang mengerjakan soal matematika.<br /><br />2. Jawaban yang benar adalah (C) has been endeavouring.<br />Pembahasan:<br />Kalimat ini menunjukkan bahwa pekerjaan mencari hasil penelitian sedang berlangsung dalam waktu yang telah berlangsung selama tiga jam ("for three hours"). Bentuk Present Perfect Continuous Tense "has been endeavouring" digunakan untuk menggambarkan tindakan yang dimulai di masa lalu, berlanjut hingga saat ini, dan masih relevan.<br /><br />3. Jawaban yang benar adalah (C) has not finished.<br />Pembahasan:<br />Kalimat ini menyatakan bahwa pembicara (the speaker) belum selesai ("has not finished") memberikan pidato publiknya. Kita menggunakan bentuk Present Perfect Tense untuk menyatakan tindakan yang dimulai di masa lalu dan berlanjut hingga saat ini dengan relevansi terhadap saat sekarang.<br /><br />4. Jawaban yang benar adalah (A) monitors.<br />Pembahasan:<br />Kalimat ini menjelaskan tugas polisi untuk memantau ("monitors") lalu lintas, terutama selama jam sibuk ("during rush hours"). Pilihan yang sesuai adalah bentuk Simple Present Tense "monitors" karena itu menggambarkan tindakan yang umum dan berulang pada waktu tertentu.<br />
