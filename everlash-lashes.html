Dia juga memiliki dua tanduk pendek di kepalanya. Seperti unta, jerapah bisa bertahan lama tanpa meminum air. Salah satu sumber air yang ia dapatkan diperoleh dari dedaunan yang dia makan dari pohon. Pohonnya tinggi jadi jerapah bisa mencapai daun yang paling tinggi. Jerapah memiliki dua metode melindungi diri.
