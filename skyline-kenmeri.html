If you visit Seattle,  arrive with this list in hand and you'll be off to a foolproof start for exploring the Emerald City's most unforgettable sights and sounds If you visit Seattle,  do the following things: 1. Feel the fresh air on your face as you sail to Bainbrige Island on a Washington State Ferry.  From the ferry you can enjoy the view of Seattle skyline.  If you want to enjoy Bainbrige Island,  stroll around downtown's galleries,  boutiques,  coffee houses and cafes.  Seasonal gardens and natural woodlands at the Boedel Reserve are as the other options.2. Why don't you tour the Pike Place Market's produce stands to buy something you've never tasted.  The Pike Place Market is much more than a farmers'  market.  Its entire district is full of shopping,  attractions and favorite sights.  The area is festival of sounds,  tastes and smells and it is part of the reason.  It's called the'soul of Seattle'.  Unless you have allergic to noises,  make sure you take time to spot these beloved icons.3.  Book a night at one of the many cozy B&amp;  Bs or resorts available throughout the Sun Juan Islands.  Cozy bed and breakfasts are the perfect way to enjoy the friendly island culture.  If you have enough time,  tour the numerous art galleries in Friday Harbor.  You can also enjoy naturalist-guided tours,  wildlife spotting,  whale watching and storm watching.4.  See exciting and experimental works at Chihuly Garden and Glass.  A visit to this site is an opportunity to take full advantage of the location at the Seattle Center,  a premier destination for arts,  entertainment and leisure activities.  If you visit this city,  you should explore the Space Needle and Pacific Science Center.  Experience Music Project and a variety of cultural activities offered throughout the year.5.  Watch the world's most sophisticated aircraft be built before your eyes at the Boeing factory in Mukilteo.  If you are curious to know about it,  you should explore the dynamics of flight and experience new aviation innovation.  Go behind the scenes at Boeing to watch the very same jets you may one day be a passenger on being assembled.6.  Tour the Theo Chocolate Factory in Freemont and learn how their delicious confections are made This factory has a mission to create change in the Democratic Republic of Congo(DRC)  where it has 300,000 square miles of farmable land but only 2%  is being farmed due to conflict there.

Questions 20 to 23 refer to the following text
West Cornwall
            The area that was once the engine room of Britain’s mining industry has a haunting beauty. The towns of Redruth and its sibling Camborne were West Cornwall’s mining heartland. It is a place where one must spend time to recognize the beauty. Five kilometers to the west, the village of Portreath overlooks an area of sand, book ended by cliffs.
            Portreath is the best village in the area. It began as the playground of the Redruth Camborne miners. Now it is slightly middle-class resort filled in summer with families on holidays. In the mid 19th century the small harbour bustled with sailing vessels.
            Cornwall’s mining land-scapes have been nominated for World Heritage status. At dusk, we climb Cam Brea, an Iron Age settlement and hill fort close to Redruth. We count more than a dozen mine chimneys against the evening skyline. Standing on top of Cam Brea, it is hard to believe that 150 years ago these relics of the mining industry shrieked with the sound of heavy machinery. Now, except for chirruping of the birds, all is silent.
            If you’ve got the legs and the stamina there’s no better way to get to know Cornwall’s wild Atlantic seaboard than to hike it. The National Trust looks after 260 km of Cornish coastline, sand dunes and sheltered bays for walkers. On a breezy day with the sun flitting in and out of clouds, we take the local bus from Redruth to St Agnes and hike 12 km south to Portreath.
            The 18 km cycling trail is the best in that part of the country. It takes you from Portreath in the west to the river at Devoran in the southeast. The path follows the tracks of the horse drawn tramways that once hauled ore to the ports.
            Surfing is popular on the beaches of west Cornwall. There is always a hardly group of surfers in the waves in all weather. New quay is the surf capital but there are plenty of good beaches north towards Padstow and south to St Ives.

                                            Text 1 Venice is a tourist attraction itself, capital of passion and romanticism, home to some of the world most impressive buildings, awesome museums and fine art galleries. Art is everywhere here and Venice is visited by many thousands of visitors every year. It is a city that must be discovered on foot, perhaps by losing oneself in the magical labyrinth created by lanes, small and large squares and canals. It is "Imperative visiting San Marco Square, the well-known Rialto Bridge, the refined Doge's Palace, the Bridge of Sighs and more Venice is really a place like no other, with its unusual alleys, watercourses and way of life. It guarantees emotional enchantment all year round. The main and extraordinary waterway is the Canal Grande, which is over 3800 meters, with its majestic palaces and splendid Rialto Bridge. With its typical upside-down S shape, it splits the city from Piazzale Roma to St. Mark's Basin. Studies have revealed that once may have been a bed of the river Brenta, later diverted. Text 2 Pulau Merah is one of awesome 'hidden' gems that Indonesia has. It is still virgin with many trees. It has a vast white sandy beach stretching for miles, featuring the island in the middle of the bay. Not only sandy beach, there are also great scenery with many amazing tremendous rocks and sunset. Moreover, the constant and huge waves invite surfers to have an enjoyable surfing and experience the mystical feeling of surfing next to this gigantic "red island" rock in the middle of the waves though it is a very forgiving beach break. It takes 3 hours driving from Banyuwangi to reach this place or about 1 hour from Purwoharjo. Text 3 Lake Maninjau is a volcanic lake that is located at 461,50 meters above the sea level in Tanjung Raya, the district of Agam, West Sumatra Its width is 99, 5 km2 and with 4, 95 meters of the maximum depth. There are two alternative ways to reach the destination, from the east and from the west if you choose to start it from the west, it will be started from Padang to Lubuk Basung (the capital of Agam district) passing by Pariaman city. It spends about a half an hour hours by land using any accessible public transportation or rent car that can be easily found there. If you choose the alternative way from east, It will be started from Padang to Bukit Tinggi and continued to the destination passing by "Kelok 44" for approximately three hours Lake Maninjau has a wonderful scenery. We may compare it with other famous lakes from all over the world such as lake in Luzern, Zurich, and Switzerland. Lake Maninjau has shinny turquoise water with the flapping leaves of coconut trees and hills around the lake that make a wonderful view in Lake Maninjau Text 4 Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, is the largest city in Indonesia. The city has all the modern amenities. But in its quest for modernization the city has not forgotten its past and has carefully preserved its rich cultural heritage. Apart from the skyscrapers, colonial structures built by European powers form an integral part of Jakarta's skyline. Jakarta is a city of many fascinating facets. It is the main gateway to Indonesia. In recent years, Jakarta has expanded its facilities for visitors with multi star luxury hotels, fine restaurants, exciting nightlife and modern shopping centers.

The London Eye is still something referred to as the Millennium Wheel and over the years it has had a number of different names due to the sponsor of the wheel at the time. The first official title of the Eye was the British Airways London Eye before being known as the Merlin Entertainments London Eye before changing to the EDF Energy London Eye. In the latter half of 2014, the official name of the wheel reverted to the London Eye but effective January 2015 changed to the Coca-Cola London Eye as they became the official corporate sponsor. No matter what title is given to the wheel, it is one of the most prominent features in London, dominating the skyline and bringing in a great number of tourists on a daily basis. The structure of the London Eye stands at 135 metres/ 443 feet, and the wheel itself has a diameter of 120 metres/ 394 feet. When the London Eye was first put in place, it was the tallest Ferris wheel in the world but it has since been superseded by wheels in Nanchang, Singapore and Las Vegas. However, the London Eye is differentiated from the others by the fact that it is maintained by an A-Frame on just one side of the wheel which means that the wheel is often referred to being the “world’s tallest cantilevered observation wheel”.The London Eye is also the tallest wheel of its kind in Europe and provides one of the best views of London. There is competition from the Shard which holds a higher position than the wheel is able to obtain but the fact that the Wheel provides a number of viewpoints ensures it remains a huge attraction. In fact, with more than 3.5 million visitors paying for access to the wheel on an annual basis, the London Eye is cited as being the most popular London attraction that people pay to use. It is instantly recognisable and it is featured regularly in films and TV shows.</a>

The Palace of Culture and Science has dominated the Warsaw skyline for over 50 years, and is still one of the tallest landmarks in Europe. It was a personal gift from Joseph Stalin to the Polish people and he sent 3,500 workers from the former Soviet Union to build it. Work on the building lasted from May 1952 until July 1955 and 16 workers died in accidents during construction. It stands 231 metres high and it has got 42 storeys and 3,288 rooms including three theatres, a swimming pool, a museum and a congress hall. Today it hosts exhibitions and concerts and it is the home of a Polish university. It is also one of the city's most popular tourist attractions and every year thousands of people visit the terrace on the 35th loor and enjoy the views across the city. Taking Liberties Since 1886, the Statue of Liberty has been one of the most famous monuments in America - in fact, the world. The statue was a gift to America from the French people. They buile the statue in France and then shipped it across the Atlantic Ocean in 350 picces and re-built it in New York, They completed the work in 1886, and about a million people watched the opening parade on 28 October of that year. At the time, the Statue of Liberty was the tallest structure in New York at 93 metres and until 1902 the Americans used it as a lighthouse. Ships' captains could see its electric light from 40 kilometres away. Since then, although they have built many taller buildings, the Statue of Liberty is still an impressive sight, and millions of visitors have climbed the 354 steps to the top. Queen of the Castle Balmoral Castle in Scotland was a present for Queen Victoria from her husband, Prince Albert, in 1852. The countryside around the castle is spectacular, and includes Lochnagar, a mountain 1,160 metres high. The royal couple decided that the original castle was too small, so they built a new one. They completed it in 1856, with a beautiful tower about 30 metres high. The castle has belonged to the British royal family since that time, and each new generation has improved the property. Today, the queen and her family always reside at Balmoral when they visit Scotland. The castle grounds have been open to the public for over 35 years, and visitors can also visit the ballroom in the castle.soalnya 1find five 5 famous building in the world ?2what kind of building is it ?3where is it ?4is it a tourist attraction today ?5 write in a short paragraph for the explanation ?​</a>

Questions 20 to 23 refer to the following text
West Cornwall
            The area that was once the engine room of Britain’s mining industry has a haunting beauty. The towns of Redruth and its sibling Camborne were West Cornwall’s mining heartland. It is a place where one must spend time to recognize the beauty. Five kilometers to the west, the village of Portreath overlooks an area of sand, book ended by cliffs.
            Portreath is the best village in the area. It began as the playground of the Redruth Camborne miners. Now it is slightly middle-class resort filled in summer with families on holidays. In the mid 19th century the small harbour bustled with sailing vessels.
            Cornwall’s mining land-scapes have been nominated for World Heritage status. At dusk, we climb Cam Brea, an Iron Age settlement and hill fort close to Redruth. We count more than a dozen mine chimneys against the evening skyline. Standing on top of Cam Brea, it is hard to believe that 150 years ago these relics of the mining industry shrieked with the sound of heavy machinery. Now, except for chirruping of the birds, all is silent.
            If you’ve got the legs and the stamina there’s no better way to get to know Cornwall’s wild Atlantic seaboard than to hike it. The National Trust looks after 260 km of Cornish coastline, sand dunes and sheltered bays for walkers. On a breezy day with the sun flitting in and out of clouds, we take the local bus from Redruth to St Agnes and hike 12 km south to Portreath.
            The 18 km cycling trail is the best in that part of the country. It takes you from Portreath in the west to the river at Devoran in the southeast. The path follows the tracks of the horse drawn tramways that once hauled ore to the ports.
            Surfing is popular on the beaches of west Cornwall. There is always a hardly group of surfers in the waves in all weather. New quay is the surf capital but there are plenty of good beaches north towards Padstow and south to St Ives.

                            17. Find and write the adjectives in the text!!mencari kata sifat​ dalam teks tersebutThe London Eye The London Eye is a massive Ferris Wheel which is located on the South Bank, right on the River Thames. The London Eye is still something referred to as the Millennium Wheel and over the years it has had a number of different names due to the sponsor of the wheel at the time. The first official title of the Eye was the British Airways London Eye before being known as the Merlin Entertainments London Eye before changing to the EDF Energy London Eye. In the latter half of 2014, the official name of the wheel reverted to the London Eye but effective January 2015 changed to the Coca-Cola London Eye as they became the official corporate sponsor. No matter what title is given to the wheel, it is one of the most prominent features in London, dominating the skyline and bringing in a great number of tourists on a daily basis. The structure of the London Eye stands at 135 metres/ 443 feet, and the wheel itself has a diameter of 120 metres/ 394 feet. When the London Eye was first put in place, it was the tallest Ferris wheel in the world but it has since been superseded by wheels in Nanchang, Singapore and Las Vegas. However, the London Eye is differentiated from the others by the fact that it is maintained by an A-Frame on just one side of the wheel which means that the wheel is often referred to being the “world’s tallest cantilevered observation wheel”.The London Eye is also the tallest wheel of its kind in Europe and provides one of the best views of London. There is competition from the Shard which holds a higher position than the wheel is able to obtain but the fact that the Wheel provides a number of viewpoints ensures it remains a huge attraction. In fact, with more than 3.5 million visitors paying for access to the wheel on an annual basis, the London Eye is cited as being the most popular London attraction that people pay to use. It is instantly recognisable and it is featured regularly in films and TV shows.</h2><br />

The Palace of Culture and Science has dominated the Warsaw skyline for over 50 years, and is still one of the tallest landmarks in Europe. It was a personal gift from Joseph Stalin to the Polish people and he sent 3,500 workers from the former Soviet Union to build it. Work on the building lasted from May 1952 until July 1955 and 16 workers died in accidents during construction. It stands 231 metres high and it has got 42 storeys and 3,288 rooms including three theatres, a swimming pool, a museum and a congress hall. Today it hosts exhibitions and concerts and it is the home of a Polish university. It is also one of the city's most popular tourist attractions and every year thousands of people visit the terrace on the 35th loor and enjoy the views across the city. Taking Liberties Since 1886, the Statue of Liberty has been one of the most famous monuments in America - in fact, the world. The statue was a gift to America from the French people. They buile the statue in France and then shipped it across the Atlantic Ocean in 350 picces and re-built it in New York, They completed the work in 1886, and about a million people watched the opening parade on 28 October of that year. At the time, the Statue of Liberty was the tallest structure in New York at 93 metres and until 1902 the Americans used it as a lighthouse. Ships' captains could see its electric light from 40 kilometres away. Since then, although they have built many taller buildings, the Statue of Liberty is still an impressive sight, and millions of visitors have climbed the 354 steps to the top. Queen of the Castle Balmoral Castle in Scotland was a present for Queen Victoria from her husband, Prince Albert, in 1852. The countryside around the castle is spectacular, and includes Lochnagar, a mountain 1,160 metres high. The royal couple decided that the original castle was too small, so they built a new one. They completed it in 1856, with a beautiful tower about 30 metres high. The castle has belonged to the British royal family since that time, and each new generation has improved the property. Today, the queen and her family always reside at Balmoral when they visit Scotland. The castle grounds have been open to the public for over 35 years, and visitors can also visit the ballroom in the castle.soalnya 1find five 5 famous building in the world ?2what kind of building is it ?3where is it ?4is it a tourist attraction today ?5 write in a short paragraph for the explanation ?​</h2><br />
