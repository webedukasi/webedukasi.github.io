	In the middle of a bright day.  I planned to have a lunch in a new restaurant.  I drove along the West Road at a reasonable speed.
	About fifty meters before the crossroads, a pedestrian, who was walking on the sidewalk, suddenly ran across the road in front of my car.  I was so surprised that I braked as hard as I could.  I was really in a panic and I had to swerve to avoid the pedestrian.  I crashed into a car which was parked by the side of the road.
	Fortunately, the pedestrian was not injured, but I had a bad cut on my face because my head hit the windshield.  I had forgotten to put on my seat belt.  An ambulance took me to the hospital where I had to have five stitches and took a rest for several hours.
	There was a lot of damage to my car; the windshield was broken and the fender was badly dented.  I was interviewed by the police in the hospital.  I promised my self to be careful the next time I drive the car.

                                            "Click!" That's the sound of safety. That's the sound of survival. That's the sound of a seat belt locking in place. Seat belts save lives and that's a fact. That's why I don't drive anywhere until mine is on tight. Choosing to wear your seat belt is a simple as choosing between life and death. Which one do you choose? 
Think about it. When you're driving in a car, you may be going 60 MPH or faster. That car is zipping down the road. Then somebody ahead of you locks up his or her brakes. Your driver doesn't have time to stop. The car that you are in crashes. Your car was going 60 miles per hour. Now it has suddenly stopped. Your body, however, is still going 60 MPH. What's going to stop your body? Will it be the windshield or your seat belt? Every time that you get into a car you make that choice. I choose the seat belt.  
Some people think that seat belts are uncool. They think that seat belts cramp their style, or that seat belts are uncomfortable. To them I say, what's more uncomfortable? Wearing a seat belt or flying through a car windshield? What's more uncool? Being safely anchored to a car, or skidding across the road in your jean shorts? Wearing a seat belt is both cooler and more comfortable than the alternatives. 
Let's just take a closer look at your choices. If you are not wearing your seat belt, you can hop around the car and slide in and out of your seat easily. That sounds like a lot of fun. But you are also more likely to die or suffer serious injuries. If you are wearing a seat belt, you have to stay in your seat. That's no fun. But you are much more likely to walk away unharmed from a car accident. Hmmm... A small pleasure for a serious pain. That's a tough choice. I think that I'll avoid the serious pain.   
How about giving money away? Do you like to give your money away? Probably not. And when you don't wear your seat belt, you are begging to give your money away. That's because kids are required to wear seat belts in every state in America. If you're riding in a car, and you don't have a seat belt on, the police can give you or your driver a ticket. Then you will have to give money to the city. I'd rather keep my money, but you can spend yours how you want.  
Wearing a seat belt does not make you invincible. You can still get hurt or killed while wearing your seat belt. But wearing them has proven to be safer than driving without them.  You are much less likely to be killed in a car wreck if you are wearing a seat belt. You are much less likely to get seriously injured if you are wearing one. So why not take the safer way? Why not go the way that has been proven to result in fewer deaths? You do want to live, don't you?

                                             Golf superstar Tiger Woods has returned to his Florida home to continue recovering from serious injuries he sustained in a car crash last month, according to a statement on his social media. "Happy to report that I am back home continuing my recovery... I will be recovering at home and working on getting stronger every day," he said in a Twitter statement posted Tuesday. Woods was hurt early on Feb. 23 when the SUV he was driving on a downhill stretch of the road struck a raised median in a coastal Los Angeles suburb, crossed into oncoming lanes, and flipped several times. Authorities said he had to be pulled out through the windshield. He had a lengthy surgery that day at Harbor- UCLA Medical Center for shattered tibia and fibula bones of his lower right leg in multiple locations. Those were stabilized with a rod in his tibia. Additional injuries to the bones in his foot and ankle required screws and pins. He was transferred to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for follow-up procedures. Woods thanked the medical staff at both hospitals for taking care of him and expressed his gratitude for the outpouring of support from his fans and the public.

Shortly before theirdeaths were announced, Richard Gephardt, Democrat presidential hopeful,delivered a blistering attack on Bush's foreign policy which was driven, he said,by "machismo" and "arrogant unilateralism". Bush, he continued, treated U.S.allies "like so many files on America's windshield". He added: "Foreign policy isn'ta John Wayne movie." The attack on the villa where Saddam's sons were hidingmight be seen as driving home the point.

                                            It was a Monday morning, just about 8:15. I was actually a little early for once and was glad I didn’t have to race to work. It was my second week as a bank teller at Harrison Savings and Loan. There had been some freezing rain earlier that morning, but the roads seemed clear as I pulled out of the driveway. I turned left at the light, right at the Dunkin Donuts, and then left again onto the onramp for Route 61. I sped up to merge with the oncoming rush-hour traffic when suddenly I felt my car, a brand new SUV, lose control. I’d hit a patch of ice. What happened next probably lasted no more than fifteen seconds, but it felt like hours. I spun around like a top, turning two full revolutions as I crossed the two southbound lanes. Then I hit the median strip and the car flipped over as it crossed into the northbound traffic. I skidded across the highway and the car stopped in the right-hand lane. There I was, upside-down and backwards, after it slipped sideways on the highway, and somehow I was alive. Somehow I hadn’t hit a single car. However, I had no time to appreciate that miracle, because when I looked out the shattered windshield, I saw an 18-wheeler was bearing down upon meat about 65 miles an hour. There was no time to get out of the car. (Adapted from: 501 Writing Prompts, 2003) After you read the text above, answer the following questions: a. What is the main idea of paragraph 1? b. What does the word ‘it’ in ‘What happened next probably lasted no more than fifteen seconds, but it felt like hours.’ (par. 2) refer to? c. What can you infer about the author’s car after it lost control from the word ‘skidded’ based on the information in paragraph 2? Explain the meaning of the word skidded. d.

                            4. 
	In the middle of a bright day.  I planned to have a lunch in a new restaurant.  I drove along the West Road at a reasonable speed.
	About fifty meters before the crossroads, a pedestrian, who was walking on the sidewalk, suddenly ran across the road in front of my car.  I was so surprised that I braked as hard as I could.  I was really in a panic and I had to swerve to avoid the pedestrian.  I crashed into a car which was parked by the side of the road.
	Fortunately, the pedestrian was not injured, but I had a bad cut on my face because my head hit the windshield.  I had forgotten to put on my seat belt.  An ambulance took me to the hospital where I had to have five stitches and took a rest for several hours.
	There was a lot of damage to my car; the windshield was broken and the fender was badly dented.  I was interviewed by the police in the hospital.  I promised my self to be careful the next time I drive the car.

                            6. "Click!" That's the sound of safety. That's the sound of survival. That's the sound of a seat belt locking in place. Seat belts save lives and that's a fact. That's why I don't drive anywhere until mine is on tight. Choosing to wear your seat belt is a simple as choosing between life and death. Which one do you choose? 
Think about it. When you're driving in a car, you may be going 60 MPH or faster. That car is zipping down the road. Then somebody ahead of you locks up his or her brakes. Your driver doesn't have time to stop. The car that you are in crashes. Your car was going 60 miles per hour. Now it has suddenly stopped. Your body, however, is still going 60 MPH. What's going to stop your body? Will it be the windshield or your seat belt? Every time that you get into a car you make that choice. I choose the seat belt.  
Some people think that seat belts are uncool. They think that seat belts cramp their style, or that seat belts are uncomfortable. To them I say, what's more uncomfortable? Wearing a seat belt or flying through a car windshield? What's more uncool? Being safely anchored to a car, or skidding across the road in your jean shorts? Wearing a seat belt is both cooler and more comfortable than the alternatives. 
Let's just take a closer look at your choices. If you are not wearing your seat belt, you can hop around the car and slide in and out of your seat easily. That sounds like a lot of fun. But you are also more likely to die or suffer serious injuries. If you are wearing a seat belt, you have to stay in your seat. That's no fun. But you are much more likely to walk away unharmed from a car accident. Hmmm... A small pleasure for a serious pain. That's a tough choice. I think that I'll avoid the serious pain.   
How about giving money away? Do you like to give your money away? Probably not. And when you don't wear your seat belt, you are begging to give your money away. That's because kids are required to wear seat belts in every state in America. If you're riding in a car, and you don't have a seat belt on, the police can give you or your driver a ticket. Then you will have to give money to the city. I'd rather keep my money, but you can spend yours how you want.  
Wearing a seat belt does not make you invincible. You can still get hurt or killed while wearing your seat belt. But wearing them has proven to be safer than driving without them.  You are much less likely to be killed in a car wreck if you are wearing a seat belt. You are much less likely to get seriously injured if you are wearing one. So why not take the safer way? Why not go the way that has been proven to result in fewer deaths? You do want to live, don't you?

                            9.  Golf superstar Tiger Woods has returned to his Florida home to continue recovering from serious injuries he sustained in a car crash last month, according to a statement on his social media. "Happy to report that I am back home continuing my recovery... I will be recovering at home and working on getting stronger every day," he said in a Twitter statement posted Tuesday. Woods was hurt early on Feb. 23 when the SUV he was driving on a downhill stretch of the road struck a raised median in a coastal Los Angeles suburb, crossed into oncoming lanes, and flipped several times. Authorities said he had to be pulled out through the windshield. He had a lengthy surgery that day at Harbor- UCLA Medical Center for shattered tibia and fibula bones of his lower right leg in multiple locations. Those were stabilized with a rod in his tibia. Additional injuries to the bones in his foot and ankle required screws and pins. He was transferred to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for follow-up procedures. Woods thanked the medical staff at both hospitals for taking care of him and expressed his gratitude for the outpouring of support from his fans and the public. Woods lives in Jupiter, Fla., where he is expected to remain as he completes his recovery. Investigators have said there is no evidence that Woods was impaired at the time of the crash, which did not involve any other vehicles. . They have also said he will not face any charges as a result of the crash, yet the investigation is ongoing Adopted ) 1. Tiger Woods is being recovered from serious injuries due to ___2.

And withthe dictator's sons out of the way forever, Iraqis are more confident aboutcontinuing the resistance against the American occupies. Shortly before theirdeaths were announced, Richard Gephardt, Democrat presidential hopeful,delivered a blistering attack on Bush's foreign policy which was driven, he said,by "machismo" and "arrogant unilateralism". Bush, he continued, treated U.S.allies "like so many files on America's windshield". He added: "Foreign policy isn'ta John Wayne movie." The attack on the villa where Saddam's sons were hidingmight be seen as driving home the point. Instead, the announcement that theyhad been killed by the U.S. Troops in a shoot-out is welcomed by Tony Blair as"great news".

                            19. It was a Monday morning, just about 8:15. I was actually a little early for once and was glad I didn’t have to race to work. It was my second week as a bank teller at Harrison Savings and Loan. There had been some freezing rain earlier that morning, but the roads seemed clear as I pulled out of the driveway. I turned left at the light, right at the Dunkin Donuts, and then left again onto the onramp for Route 61. I sped up to merge with the oncoming rush-hour traffic when suddenly I felt my car, a brand new SUV, lose control. I’d hit a patch of ice. What happened next probably lasted no more than fifteen seconds, but it felt like hours. I spun around like a top, turning two full revolutions as I crossed the two southbound lanes. Then I hit the median strip and the car flipped over as it crossed into the northbound traffic. I skidded across the highway and the car stopped in the right-hand lane. There I was, upside-down and backwards, after it slipped sideways on the highway, and somehow I was alive. Somehow I hadn’t hit a single car. However, I had no time to appreciate that miracle, because when I looked out the shattered windshield, I saw an 18-wheeler was bearing down upon meat about 65 miles an hour. There was no time to get out of the car. (Adapted from: 501 Writing Prompts, 2003) After you read the text above, answer the following questions: a. What is the main idea of paragraph 1? b. What does the word ‘it’ in ‘What happened next probably lasted no more than fifteen seconds, but it felt like hours.’ (par. 2) refer to? c. What can you infer about the author’s car after it lost control from the word ‘skidded’ based on the information in paragraph 2? Explain the meaning of the word skidded. d. Continue the story based on the information in the text in less than 5 sentences.​</h2><br />
