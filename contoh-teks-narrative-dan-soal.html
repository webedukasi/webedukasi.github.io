'You should teach me some of yours!'<br />'Well, maybe some day, when I have the time, I may teach you a few of the simpler ones,' replied the fox airily.<br /><br />Just then they heard the barking of a pack of dogs in the distance. The barking grew louder and louder - the dogs were coming in their direction! At once the cat ran to the nearest tree and climbed into its branches, well out of reach of any dog. 'This is the trick I told you about, the only one I know,' said the cat. 'Which one of your hundred tricks are you going to use?'<br /><br />The fox sat silently under the tree, wondering which trick she should use. Before she could make up her mind, the dogs arrived.

"Kamu harus mengajariku beberapa trik mu!"<br /><br />"Yah, mungkin suatu hari, ketika saya punya waktu, saya mungkin mengajarkan kamu beberapa trik yang sederhana," jawab rubah ringan.<br /><br />Sesaat kemudian mereka mendengar gonggongan sekawanan anjing di kejauhan. menggonggong semakin keras - anjing datang menuju ke arah mereka! Seketika kucing berlari ke pohon terdekat dan naik ke cabang-cabangnya, di luar jangkauan dari setiap anjing. 'Ini adalah trik saya katakan tadi, satu-satunya yang saya tahu, "kata kucing. ' mana salah satu dari seratus trik anda yang anda akan gunakan?'<br /><br />Rubah duduk diam di bawah pohon, bertanya-tanya trik apa yang dia harus gunakan. Sebelum dia bisa mengambil keputusan, anjing tiba. Mereka menyergap rubah dan mencabik-cabiknya.<br /><br />Pesan Moral:<br />Sebuah rencana tunggal yang bekerja lebih baik dari seratus rencana diragukan.<br /><br />Semoga membantu dan tolong di jadikan jawaban tercerdas ya.

The magician asked him to work together with him. If Aladdin could do, he would get a lot of gold coins and jewellery. The magician asked Aladdin to go inside the cave and find a magical lamp there. He also gave a ring and said, “If you are in any trouble, rub this ring and a genie will come to your rescue!”<br /><br />Aladdin went into the cave. Inside the cave, Aladdin was surprised by what he saw. Every corner was full of gold and treasures. A few minutes later, he found the lamp and quickly returned to the entrance of the cave. Aladdin called out, “Magician, I have found the lamp.” “Excellent,” answered the magician. “Quick, pass it to me!”<br /><br />Aladdin did not trust the magician so he said, “Not so fast Magician. You must help me out of this cave first.”<br /><br />The magician became very angry. When Aladdin was walking to the entrance, the magician pushed a huge rock over the entrance of the cave and left Aladdin and the lamp behind. Aladdin tried to move the rock all by himself, but it was too big and heavy, “Oh no! I am trapped in the cave!” he cried.<br /><br />Suddenly, he remembered the magic ring. He rubbed it with the palm of his hand. To his surprise, a genie appeared before him and in a powerful voice said, “Master, I am the Genie of the ring. How can I help you?”<br /><br />Aladdin was frightened, but he soon found the courage to ask, “Could you please send me back to my house?” In no time at all Aladdin was back home.<br /><br />Aladdin took out the lamp. He wondered what would happen if he rubbed it. As Aladdin was rubbing it, all of a sudden another enormous genie stood before him. The genie of the lamp said, “Master, your wish is my command.” Aladdin was very excited and wished for an enormous palace and bags full of gold.<br /><br />One day, a beautiful princess was passing by Aladdin’s palace.

                        Going Back for Seconds<br /><br />Styler leaned towards the clock and pinched something from the air. I felt the room move. Everything move. She held it out to me and I dropped the paper plane I'd spent all afternoon folding and refolding and never getting right.<br />"A second," she said, pushing my grasping hands away and plucking the handkerchief from the top pocket of my jacket. Pinstriped, my suit a perfect miniaturized copy of my father's. Styler wrapped the second in it, made me put it in the inside pocket, the one that carries things closest to your heart. Usually a man's wallet. Figures.<br />"Don't waste it. And for goodness sake, if you feel a sneeze coming on--use your sleeve."<br /><br />It would be wrong to say I forgot about that second, right to say I didn't give it more than a glancing thought every now and again.<br />What value a second when life ate up minutes, galloped through hours, gorged on days and....<br />"What do you want to do with this?" Helen asked, holding up the tiny suit. "Did you used to do ventriloquism?"<br />"It was mine," I said and saw her face was troubled, yet fascinated. The suit was the only thing in the room cut in my father's image. I hadn't gone out of my way to disappoint him--like all things financial were his natural gift, mine was falling way below people's expectations. Helen pulled a paper plane from the pocket. Badly made, a waste of the time I'd spent trying to do it.<br />"There's something in the inside pocket. It's a handkerchief. Urgh, there's something in it."<br />She held the handkerchief up by its collected corners and I reached forward and grabbed it before it could unfold whereupon what sprinkled out would not be dried snot, but the second that Styler had given me.<br />"The suit?" she reminded me, after I'd spent a long time staring at the handkerchief.<br />

jungle,where elephants helped the men work.They could lift up the 
heaviest logs.then , Mantu had an elephant of his very own. Hisname was 
Opie. He was just a baby and Mantu loved<br />him very much. Mantu whispered to Opie’s ear that<br />someday he would become the biggest, strongest and<br />bravest elephant in the jungle. The other elephants<br />heard this. They began to laugh and made rude noises<br />with their trunks. “We’re so big and tall, but you’re<br />so small. You’re nothing at all,” said one of the big<br />elephants.<br />Mantu looked up at the huge elephant with a<br />mishievous glint in his eye. “You’re so tall and can<br />see far away. We can see what is happening down<br />here in the jungle. In fact, we would be the worst to see<br />any slithering snakes that may be a danger. “After<br />hearing the word snakes, the elephants screeched<br />and off they gwents thundering in fright.<br />“Did I say there were snakes?” giggled Mantu. “No,<br />I don’t think so,” smiled Opie.

            <br />                                Queen of Arabia and Three Sheiks

<br />

<br />Maura, who like to be thought of as the 
most beautiful and powerful queen of Arabia, had many suitors. One by 
one she discarded them, until her list was reduced to just three sheiks.
 The three sheiks were all equally young and handsome. They were also 
rich and strong. It was very hard to decide who would be the best of 
them.

<br /> 



One evening, Maura disguised herself and
 went to the camp of the three sheiks. As they were about to have 
dinner, Maura asked them for something to eat. The first gave her some 
left over food. The second Sheik gave her some unappetizing camel’s 
tail. The third sheik, who was called Hakim, offered her some of the 
most tender and tasty meat. After dinner, the disguised queen left the 
sheik’s camp.

<br />

The following day, the queen invited the
 three sheiks to dinner at her palace. She ordered her servant to give 
each one exactly what they had given her the evening before. Hakim, who 
received a plate of delicious meat, refused to eat it if the other two 
sheiks could not share it with him.

<br />

This Sheik Hakim’s act finally convinced
 Queen Maura that he was the man for her. “Without question, Hakim is 
the most generous of you” she announced her choice to the sheiks. “So it
 is Hakim I will marry”.

hunter approaching carrying. The doves desperately fluttered their wings
 trying to get out, but to no avail. The king had an idea. He advised 
all the doves to fly up together carrying the net with them.<br />
Each dove picked up a portion of the net and together they flew off 
carrying the net with them. The hunter looked up in astonishment. He 
tried to follow them, but they were flying high over hills and valleys. 
They flew to a hill near a city of temples where there lived a mouse who
 could help them. He was a faithful friend of the dove king.<br />
The mouse agreed saying that he would set the king free first. The king 
insisted that he first free his subjects and the king last. The mouse 
understood the king’s feelings and complied with his wishes. He began to
 cut the net and one by one all the doves were freed including the dove

                        Narrative Text<br /><br />The Cat and The Rat story<br /><br />Folktale from Japan<br /><br /> <br /><br />Long ago, the God Heaven spoke to all of the animals in the world.<br /><br />“Twelve animals will be chosen to protect the world. Each one will do this for a year at a time. Come to my palace on the twelfth day of the first moon. The first twelve animals to arrive will be chosen.<br /><br />All of the animals waited excitedly for the day. The Cat however  was very forgetful and could not remember which day it was. So she asked the Rat, “Which day do we go to the palace in Heaven to be chosen to protect the world?” The Rat wanted to be chosen so he said to the Cat, “On the thirteenth day of first moon, we will all go to the palace.”<br /><br /> <br /><br />The Rat lived in the stable of the Ox. One evening, he heard the Ox getting ready to leave for the palace. “Why are you leaving so early?” asked the Rat.<br /><br />“Oh, my feet are so clumsy and slow.” Answered the Ox, “I must go now or I won’t  get there in time to be chosen.” As soon as the Ox turned to go, the Rat jumped into the bag on his back. The Ox did not know that he was carrying the Rat and he walked slowly through the night until he reached the palace. There were no other animals in front of him so he thought he must surely be the first. Just then, the Rat jumped out of the bag and ran to the gate.<br /><br />“The very first is the Rat,” he called out to the Ox.<br /><br />The Ox was very angry but not as angry as the Cat. She went to the palace on the thirteenth day as she had been told by the Rat. There was nobody about so she thought she must be the first. However, the guard called out to her.<br /><br />“You are a day too late, Cat. The animals were chosen yesterday. First the Rat, then Ox, tiger. Hare, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Sheep, Monkey, Cock, Dog and last of all, Bear. You shouldn’t be so sleepy, and look how dirty your face is! You shouldn’t was it better than you do. “With that he closed the gates.<br /><br />Since then, the Cat has hated the Rat and has always tried to catch him. She also keeps washing her face with her tongue because the guard told her how dirty her face was.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Generic structure:<br /><br />1.

The blond wood has been chipped and gouged to gray, particularly where the pick guard fell off years ago. <br /><br />No, it’s not a beautiful instrument, but it still lets me make music, and for that I will always treasure it.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Generic structure:<br /><br />1.

At once the cat ran to the nearest tree and climbed into its branches, well out of reach of any dog. 'This is the trick I told you about, the only one I know,' said the cat. 'Which one of your hundred tricks are you going to use?'

</p><p>The fox sat silently under the tree, wondering which trick she should use. Before she could make up her mind, the dogs arrived. They fell upon the fox and tore her to pieces.
