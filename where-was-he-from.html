                                            Last Friday, I saw my cousin Annan for his first flight. He was rather confused. First, when he arrived at the airport, he wanted to know why the official weighed the luggage. Then, he wondered why he needed a passport. He didn't understand why the security checked his passport. Then he asked who the flight attendant was. When he saw the plane, he couldn't understand what the pilot did and where he sat. What a lot of questions. The other passengers often watched my cousin asking many things. "He must be the boy from the village", said one of the passengers softly. I was very pleased when the plane landed safely. No questions again from my cousin. He didn't ask why the plane stopped. </a>

                            22. Last Friday, I saw my cousin Annan for his first flight. He was rather confused. First, when he arrived at the airport, he wanted to know why the official weighed the luggage. Then, he wondered why he needed a passport. He didn't understand why the security checked his passport. Then he asked who the flight attendant was. When he saw the plane, he couldn't understand what the pilot did and where he sat. What a lot of questions. The other passengers often watched my cousin asking many things. "He must be the boy from the village", said one of the passengers softly. I was very pleased when the plane landed safely. No questions again from my cousin. He didn't ask why the plane stopped. </h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Because he was dizzy while on the plane</p><br />

C. During 1920’s
D. Albert Einstein was born near the end of the 1800s in Ulf</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Albert Einstein (/ˈaɪnstaɪn/ eyen-styne;[4] bahasa Jerman: [ˈalbɛɐ̯t ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn] ( simak); 14 Maret 1879 – 18 April 1955) adalah fisikawan teoretis kelahiran Jerman[5] yang mengembangkan teori relativitas, satu dari dua pilar utama fisika modern (bersama mekanika kuantum).[3][6]:274 Karya-karyanya juga dikenal karena berpengaruh terhadap filsafat ilmu.[7][8] Persamaan Einstein yang paling dikenal adalah rumus kesetaraan massa-energi {\displaystyle E=mc^{2}}{\displaystyle E=mc^{2}}, yang dijuluki "persamaan paling terkenal di dunia".[9] Einstein menerima Nobel Fisika pada tahun 1921 "atas jasanya terhadap fisika teoretis, dan khususnya atas penemuannya tentang hukum efek fotolistrik",[10] yang menjadi langkah penting dalam pengembangan teori kuantum.
</p><p>
</p><p>Menjelang awal kariernya, Einstein berpendapat bahwa mekanika Newton tak lagi mampu menyatukan hukum mekanika klasik dengan hukum medan elektromagnetik. Hal ini mendorongnya mengembangkan teori relativitas khusus saat bekerja di Kantor Paten Swiss di Bern (1902–1909). Tetapi, ia kemudian menyadari bahwa prinsip relativitas juga dapat diperluas cakupannya pada medan gravitasi, dan ia menerbitkan sebuah makalah mengenai relativitas umum pada tahun 1916 dengan teorinya tentang gravitasi. Einstein terus meneliti masalah mekanika statistika dan teori kuantum, yang mengarah pada penjelasannya mengenai teori partikel dan gerak molekul. Einstein juga meneliti kandungan termal cahaya yang meletakkan dasar bagi teori foton cahaya. Pada tahun 1917, ia menerapkan teori relativitas umum untuk memodelkan struktur alam semesta.[11][12]
</p><p>
</p><p>Setelah menghabiskan waktu satu tahun di Praha, Einstein tinggal di Swiss antara tahun 1895 dan 1914, melepas kewarganegaraan Jermannya pada tahun 1896, dan lulus sarjana dari sekolah politeknik federal Swiss (kelak Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH) di Zürich pada tahun 1900. Setelah hidup tanpa kewarganegaraan selama lebih dari lima tahun, Einstein memperoleh kewarganegaraan Swiss pada tahun 1901, yang tetap ia pegang sampai akhir hayatnya. Pada tahun 1905, ia dianugerahi gelar PhD oleh Universitas Zurich. Pada tahun yang sama, Einstein menerbitkan empat makalah terobosan pada masa annus mirabilis (tahun mukjizat), yang menghantarkannya memasuki dunia akademis pada usia 26 tahun. Einstein mengajar fisika teoretis di Zurich dari tahun 1912 sampai 1914, kemudian pindah ke Berlin dan menjadi anggota Akademi Sains Prusia.
</p><p>
</p><p>Pada tahun 1933, ketika Einstein mengunjungi Amerika Serikat, Adolf Hitler berkuasa. Karena latar belakang Yahudinya, Einstein memilih tidak kembali ke Jerman.[13] Ia menetap di Amerika Serikat dan menjadi warga negara Amerika pada tahun 1940.[14] Menjelang Perang Dunia II, Einstein mengirim surat kepada Presiden Franklin D. Roosevelt, yang memperingatkannya mengenai potensi pengembangan "bom jenis baru yang sangat dahsyat" dan menyarankan agar AS segera memulai penelitian serupa. Sarannya ini pada akhirnya mengarah pada Proyek Manhattan. Einstein mendukung Sekutu, tetapi menentang gagasan penggunaan fisi nuklir sebagai senjata. Einstein menandatangani Manifesto Russell–Einstein bersama filsuf Britania Raya Bertrand Russell, yang menyoroti dan mengecam bahaya senjata nuklir. Ia mengabdi di Institute for Advanced Study di Princeton, New Jersey, hingga kematiannya pada tahun 1955.
</p><p>
</p><p>Einstein menerbitkan lebih dari 300 makalah ilmiah dan lebih dari 150 karya nonilmiah.[11][15] Prestasi intelektual dan orisinalitasnya menjadikan kata "Einstein" identik dengan "genius".[16] Menurut Eugene Wigner, "pemahaman Einstein lebih dalam dari Jancsi von Neumann. Pikirannya lebih tajam dan lebih orisinal daripada von Neumann. Dan itu adalah pemikiran yang sangat luar biasa."[17]</p><p></p><p></p>1. B/university of zurich<br />2.
