                                            THIS TEXT IS FOR QUESTION NUMBER 16 – 20!
The name "coronavirus" is derived from the Latin corona, meaning crown or halo. The name refers to the characteristic appearance of the infective form of the virus, which is reminiscent of a crown or a solar corona.
The virus appears to spread mainly from person to person. The transmission occurs when someone comes into contact with an infected person. For example, a cough, sneeze or handshake could cause transmission. The spread may also be caused by coming into contact with something an infected person has touched and then touching your mouth, nose or eyes.
There is no specific vaccine or medication to cure the disease, but generally, symptoms will go away on their own. However, experts recommend seeking medical care early if symptoms feel worse than a standard cold. Doctors can relieve symptoms by prescribing pain or fever medication. As far as antibiotics are concerned, they are useless to treat coronavirus.
People who think they may have been exposed to the virus should contact their healthcare provider immediately. A set of preventive measures are usually followed in case someone gets infected. This includes keeping infected people in quarantine for a certain period, generally fourteen days.
To protect yourself from the virus, here are six recommendations to follow:
	Avoid contact with people who are already infected.
	Wash your hands well and regularly for at least 20 seconds with soap and water or use hand sanitizer.

Then, complete the table with the right year. Compareyour answers with your partner's.Indonesian Independence DayThe Beginning of Dutch ColonialismIn their search for spices, the Portuguese arrived in Indonesia in 1511, followed by the Spaniards.Later, the Dutch also started their search for spices in Indonesia, which they sold in European marketswith big profits, and established the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in 1602.In 1605, Dutch colonialism began to have a foothold over Indonesian territories. The capital of SundaKelapa was named "Batavia" by the Dutch.British Temporary RuleIn 1714, the British came to Indonesia and built Fort York in Bengkulu on the west coast of Sumatrawhich was later renamed Fort Marlborough. The British stayed in Bengkulu until 1825.During the Napoleonic wars in Europe when Holland was occupied by France, Indonesia fell under therule of the British East India Company (1811-1816). Sir Thomas Stanford Raffles was appointed LieutenantGovernor General of Java and dependencies.Return of Dutch ColonialismSoon the Dutch strengthened their colonial rule. But this only sparked rebellions to seize freedom.Thomas Matulessy (Pattimura) staged a revolt against the Dutch in the Moluccas (1816-1818). PrinceDiponegoro of Mataram led a fierce struggle for freedom which was known as the Java War from 1825-1830. Tuanku Imam Bonjol led the Padri War in West Sumatera, while Teuku Umar headed the Aceh Warin North Sumatera (1873-1903). King Sisingamangaraja of the Bataks revolved against the Dutch in 1907.An attempt by the Dutch troops to occupy Bali in 1908 was repelled by King Udayana. Revolts were alsoerupting in Goa, South Sulawesi, and in South Kalimantan.Nationalist MovementsWhen all those regional wars of independence failed, Indonesian nationalists began thinking of amore organized struggle against Dutch colonialism. The move began with the founding of Boedi Oetomoby Dr. Soetomo on 20 May 1908. This organization of Indonesian intellectuals was initially set up foreducational purposes but later turned into politics.In 1924, Perhimpunan Mahasiswa Indonesia (the Indonesian Students Association) was formed byDrs. Mohammad Hatta, Dr. Sukiman and others. This organization became a driving force of the nationalistmovement to gain independence.On 28 October 1928, delegates to Indonesian Youth Congress in Jakarta pledged commitment toOne Nation, One Motherland and One Language. The "Indonesia Raya" song was introduced for the firsttime at the 2nd Indonesian Youth Congress by its composer, Wage Rudolf Supratman.The Japanese OccupationAfter the Japanese attacks of Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, Japanese Armed Forces occupied severalSoutheast Asian countries. After the fall of Singapore, Japanese invaded the Dutch East Indies and theDutch colonial army surrendered in March 1942. Soekarno and Hatta were released from their detention.ProclamationThe final defeat of Japan after the dropping of the atomic bomb in Hiroshima and Nagasaki on the 6thand 9 of August 1945 prompted the Japanese to surrender unconditionally to the Allies. This constitutesan ample opportunity for Ir. Soekarno and Drs. Mohammad Hatta to proclaim Indonesia's independenceon 17 August 1945. The draft was prepared only a few hours before earlier, on the night of August 16, bySoekarno, Hatta, and a student named Subarjo.Adapted from: http://www.bali-directory.com/article/Independence DayofRepublicofindonesia.asptolong terjemahkan ya kak​</a>

                            13. THIS TEXT IS FOR QUESTION NUMBER 16 – 20!
The name "coronavirus" is derived from the Latin corona, meaning crown or halo. The name refers to the characteristic appearance of the infective form of the virus, which is reminiscent of a crown or a solar corona.
The virus appears to spread mainly from person to person. The transmission occurs when someone comes into contact with an infected person. For example, a cough, sneeze or handshake could cause transmission. The spread may also be caused by coming into contact with something an infected person has touched and then touching your mouth, nose or eyes.
There is no specific vaccine or medication to cure the disease, but generally, symptoms will go away on their own. However, experts recommend seeking medical care early if symptoms feel worse than a standard cold. Doctors can relieve symptoms by prescribing pain or fever medication. As far as antibiotics are concerned, they are useless to treat coronavirus.
People who think they may have been exposed to the virus should contact their healthcare provider immediately. A set of preventive measures are usually followed in case someone gets infected. This includes keeping infected people in quarantine for a certain period, generally fourteen days.
To protect yourself from the virus, here are six recommendations to follow:
	Avoid contact with people who are already infected.
	Wash your hands well and regularly for at least 20 seconds with soap and water or use hand sanitizer.
A. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth if you haven't washed your hands.

Then, complete the table with the right year. Compareyour answers with your partner's.Indonesian Independence DayThe Beginning of Dutch ColonialismIn their search for spices, the Portuguese arrived in Indonesia in 1511, followed by the Spaniards.Later, the Dutch also started their search for spices in Indonesia, which they sold in European marketswith big profits, and established the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in 1602.In 1605, Dutch colonialism began to have a foothold over Indonesian territories. The capital of SundaKelapa was named "Batavia" by the Dutch.British Temporary RuleIn 1714, the British came to Indonesia and built Fort York in Bengkulu on the west coast of Sumatrawhich was later renamed Fort Marlborough. The British stayed in Bengkulu until 1825.During the Napoleonic wars in Europe when Holland was occupied by France, Indonesia fell under therule of the British East India Company (1811-1816). Sir Thomas Stanford Raffles was appointed LieutenantGovernor General of Java and dependencies.Return of Dutch ColonialismSoon the Dutch strengthened their colonial rule. But this only sparked rebellions to seize freedom.Thomas Matulessy (Pattimura) staged a revolt against the Dutch in the Moluccas (1816-1818). PrinceDiponegoro of Mataram led a fierce struggle for freedom which was known as the Java War from 1825-1830. Tuanku Imam Bonjol led the Padri War in West Sumatera, while Teuku Umar headed the Aceh Warin North Sumatera (1873-1903). King Sisingamangaraja of the Bataks revolved against the Dutch in 1907.An attempt by the Dutch troops to occupy Bali in 1908 was repelled by King Udayana. Revolts were alsoerupting in Goa, South Sulawesi, and in South Kalimantan.Nationalist MovementsWhen all those regional wars of independence failed, Indonesian nationalists began thinking of amore organized struggle against Dutch colonialism. The move began with the founding of Boedi Oetomoby Dr. Soetomo on 20 May 1908. This organization of Indonesian intellectuals was initially set up foreducational purposes but later turned into politics.In 1924, Perhimpunan Mahasiswa Indonesia (the Indonesian Students Association) was formed byDrs. Mohammad Hatta, Dr. Sukiman and others. This organization became a driving force of the nationalistmovement to gain independence.On 28 October 1928, delegates to Indonesian Youth Congress in Jakarta pledged commitment toOne Nation, One Motherland and One Language. The "Indonesia Raya" song was introduced for the firsttime at the 2nd Indonesian Youth Congress by its composer, Wage Rudolf Supratman.The Japanese OccupationAfter the Japanese attacks of Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, Japanese Armed Forces occupied severalSoutheast Asian countries. After the fall of Singapore, Japanese invaded the Dutch East Indies and theDutch colonial army surrendered in March 1942. Soekarno and Hatta were released from their detention.ProclamationThe final defeat of Japan after the dropping of the atomic bomb in Hiroshima and Nagasaki on the 6thand 9 of August 1945 prompted the Japanese to surrender unconditionally to the Allies. This constitutesan ample opportunity for Ir. Soekarno and Drs. Mohammad Hatta to proclaim Indonesia's independenceon 17 August 1945. The draft was prepared only a few hours before earlier, on the night of August 16, bySoekarno, Hatta, and a student named Subarjo.Adapted from: http://www.bali-directory.com/article/Independence DayofRepublicofindonesia.asptolong terjemahkan ya kak​</h2><br />

Belakangan, Belanda juga mulai mencari rempah-rempah di Indonesia, yang mereka jual di pasar Eropa</p><p>dengan keuntungan besar, dan mendirikan Dutch East India Company (VOC) pada 1602.

Inggris tetap di Bengkulu sampai 1825. Selama perang Napoleon di Eropa ketika Belanda diduduki oleh Perancis, Indonesia jatuh di bawah aturan British East India Company (1811-1816). Sir Thomas Stanford Raffles diangkat sebagai Letnan Gubernur Jenderal Jawa dan dependensi. Kembalinya Kolonialisme Belanda</p><p>Segera Belanda memperkuat pemerintahan kolonial mereka. Tapi ini hanya memicu pemberontak. Thomas Matulessy (Pattimura) melancarkan pemberontakan terhadap Belanda di Maluku (1816-1818).

Tuanku Imam Bonjol memimpin Perang Padri di Sumatera Barat, sementara Teuku Umar memimpin Perang Aceh di Sumatera Utara (1873-1903). Raja Sisingamangaraja dari Batak berputar melawan Belanda pada tahun 1907. Upaya pasukan Belanda untuk menduduki Bali pada tahun 1908 ditolak oleh Raja Udayana. Pemberontakan juga terjadi di Goa, Sulawesi Selatan, dan di Kalimantan Selatan. Gerakan Nasionalis Ketika semua perang kemerdekaan regional itu gagal, kaum nasionalis Indonesia mulai memikirkan perjuangan yang lebih terorganisir melawan kolonialisme Belanda. Langkah ini dimulai dengan pendirian Boedi Oetomo oleh Dr. Soetomo pada 20 Mei 1908.
