Ekspresi ini digunakan untuk menunjukkan <strong>suatu harapan atau doa</strong> terhadap suatau kejadian untuk terjadi. Dalam penggunaannya, terdapat perbedaan konteks antara '<strong>wish</strong>' dan '<strong>hope</strong>'. Kata 'wish' <strong>digunakan untuk menunjukkan harapan akan suatu hal yang hampir tidak mungkin terjadi. </strong>Sedangkan 'hope' <strong>digunakan untuk menunjukkan harapan akan suatu hal yang masih mungkin terjadi.</strong>Namun, tak selamanya <strong>Expression of hope</strong> selalu menggunakan '<strong>wish</strong>' atau '<strong>hope</strong>'. Misalnya,<strong> have a nice day </strong>juga merupakan bentuk expression of hope yang artinya <strong>'semoga harimu menyenangkan'.</strong></p><p><strong>Berikut ini adalah contoh kalimat expression of hope:</strong></p><p>1. I hope you can through all this (aku harap kamu dapat melewati semua ini).</p><p>2. I wish I have known you before (seandainya aku sudah mengenalmu sebelumnya).</p><p>3. Have a good day (semoga harimu menyenangkan). </p><p><strong>Catatan: Soal nomor 4 tidak dapat dijawab karena gambar tidak tersedia. </strong></p><p></p>Pelajari Lebih LanjutMateri tentang Apa saja fungsi congratulation  https://brainly.co.id/tugas/1577725Materi tentang 10 contoh soal expressing congratulation beserta jawaban https://brainly.co.id/tugas/13131334Materi tentang Apa perbeda'an Hope sama Wish https://brainly.co.id/tugas/2330007<p></p>Detail Jawaban<p><strong>Kelas</strong>: X</p><p><strong>Mata Pelajaran</strong>: Bahasa Inggris</p><p><strong>Bab</strong>: 2</p><p><strong>Kode</strong>: 10.5.2</p><p></p><p><strong>#AyoBelajar #SPJ2</strong></p><br />
