It's rarely to take a vacation because I'm very busy.          The way to Santolo beach is quite good, and the view is really beautiful. On our left and right is full of rice fields and many coconut trees along the way. But when we nearly arrived, there was a long traffic jam so we hardly to get in into the beach. I guess this was because of the Idul Fitri holiday, so people want to go to beach too. Then we just take a walk to the beach because it was not far. Fortunately the weather was not too hot on that day.          After we arrived, the beach was so crowded. But we still enjoyed the time by took pictures, swimming, playing sand, and go around the beach by boat. We stay overnight in the inn that we have rent before.          We got up so early in the morning that we could enjoy sunrise landscape at the beach. My cousin playing with white sand and I took a picture of him.          A day at Santolo beach felt so short, we were quite tired for playing a whole day, but we were very happy.Kasih Contoh Soal Recount Text Nya Dong​</a>
