To the extent that a lot ofpeople create an art work such as song, cake, and many others after seeing the beautiful coloursof rainbow. But, do you know how the phenomenon of the appearance of rainbow happens?Rainbow occurs because of the refraction of light. The sunlight that shines in between theraindrops is refracted by the raindrops. This process separates the white light of the sunlight intoa spectrum of different colours. The spectrum of colours are red, orange, yellow, green, blue,indigo, and violet. Or what we often memorize as the abbreviation "ROY G BIV" (in Indonesia,it is mejikuhibiniu). Then, the colours reflect in the back drops of rain and then resulting the lightwhich looks arched and becomes the rainbow.Task 2Answer the questions based on the text of Task 1 verbally!1. What is the phenomenon told by the text?2. How come does a rainbow occur?3. "...do you know how the phenomenon of the appearance of rainbow happens?"What does the underlined pronoun refer to?4.

                                            TEXT 2 How Does Rain From and What Is The Water Cycle? Let's look at the size of rain and how raindrops fall first. We'll need the Sun when the Sun shines on water on the Earth's surface, the heat of the Sun warms the water turning it into an invisible gas called water vapour.  This process the changing of water into a gas is called evaporation because gases are lighter than liquids. Water vapor rises up into the sky and the further you move up and away from the Earth's surface the colder temperature gets, so in the sky the water vapor cools and changes back into tiny water droplets. This change is called condensation, and it is the opposite of evaporation. Clouds are made up of tiny water droplets so when condensation occurs in the sky clouds form and grow. When water droplets bump into one another they stick together and grow in size they continue to grow until they are too heavy and fall as rain. They even grows they bump into one another on their journey from the cloud to the ground and every single raindrop that reaches the ground is made up of 1 million of the original tiny water droplets. Raindrops fall on the ground surface or the Sun can shine on them and the whole process happens again. This is called the water cycle and keeps water moving from the ground to the sky providing the water needed for plants animals and people to survive. 6. What does vapour mean? A. Invisible gas of the Sun. B. Very tiny particle of water in the air.C. Gas particle in the air. D. The atmosphere. 7. What makes water turn into vapour? A. The air B. The clouds C. The Sun D. The Earth8. From the first paragraph we can conclude . . . . . A. The size of rain and how raindrops fall. B. The Sun produces the invisible gas. C. The Sun is the main factor of evaporation process. D. Water turns into gas because of Earth's surface. 9. the changing of water into a gas is called evaporation (second paragraph) The underlined word is the antonym of . . . . . A. solidification B. condensation C. desiccation D. Vaporisation 10. Why does water vapor change into water droplets in the sky? A. Because the temperature isn't cold. B. Because the temperature is hot. C. Because the temperature is sizzling. D. Because the temperature is frosty. 11. The process of changing from water vapor into water droplets is . . . . . A. solidification B. condensation C. desiccation D. Evaporation 12. What will happen when condensation occur in the sky?A. Clouds will evaporate. B. Clouds will form and grow. C.

Sunlight appears to have no colours. We call in white light. It is really made up of different colours. When you see a rainbow, you see white light that has traveled trough millions of falling raindrops.
White light is a mixture of all the colours of the rainbow, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet. When white light in a drop of rain, it changes direction is called refraction. Some orange colours in the light change direction more than other and so the white light separate into its different colours.

Text #4#
Four Men entered a mosque and each busied himself in Sholah, humbly prostrating before Allah. Each one said the “Allahu Akhbar” after first having made his intention, and began to pray with humility. Meanwhile the Mu’adhdhin came in and gave the call to SALAH.
The first man blurted out to the Mu’adhdhin, “Are you calling to the prayer? Are you sure it is the right time?”
The second spoke on the spur of the moment, “You have wasted your SALAH by speaking during prayers!”
The third retorted, “Why did YOU speak? Tell your OWN self how to behave!”
The fourth mumbled, “Praise be to Allah! I wasn’t a party to their arguments.”
Thus all the four broke their Sholah and wasted it. The fault-finders went more astray than the one who made the orginal mistake. Remember! Correct yourself before correcting others.
16. What did the four men do when they entered the mosque?
a. They slept in the mosque
b. They prayed in humanity
c. They spoke one each others
d. They called for SHOLAH (ADZAN)
e. They wanted to meet with the Muadhdhin
17. Why all the four men broke their SHOLAH?
a. They spoke during SHOLAH
b. They slept during SHOLAH
c. They Sholah before taking the holy water (WUDLU)
d. Muadhdhin disturbed them
e. They Sholah before the right time
18.  What is the text above mainly tell us about?
a. Mu’adhdhin who called of prayers
b. Four men and their Sholah
c. Four men who never Sholah
d. Four men who hid in the mosque
e. Mu’adhdhin in his Sholah

One day, they had flown a long distance and were very tired. The smallest  dove picked up speed and found some rice scattered beneath a banyan tree. So all the doves landed and began to eat.       Suddenly a net fell over them and they were all trapped. They saw a hunter   approaching carrying a huge club. The doves desparately fluttered their wings trying to get  out, but no avail. The king had an idea. He advised of all the doves to fly up together carrying the net with them. Each dove picked up a portion of the net and together they flew  off carrying the net with them. They flew to a hill near a city of temples where there lived a mouse who could  help them. He was a faithful friend of the dove king.         When the mouse heard the loud noise, he went into hiding. The dove king dently  call out to him and then the mouse was happy to see him. The dove king said that they needed the mouse’s help to set them free. The mouse began to cut the net and one by one  all the doves were freed. They all thanked the mouse and flew away together.6.What is the moral lesson of the story?        A. Flying together makes the doves strong.        B. If we are united, we can get strength.        C. Animal can help one to each other.        D. The weak ones can help the strong onesTolong bantu yaaa, dijawab dengan penjelasan ​</a>

                                            How does rain form and what is water cycle?Let's look at the size of rain and how raindrops fall first.We'll need the Sun when the sun shines on water on the Earth's surface. The heat of the Sunwarms the water and turns it into an invisible gas called water vapour.The process when the water changes into gas is called evaporation because gases are lighter thanliquids. Water vapour rises up into the sky and the further it move up and away from the Earth'ssurface, the colder temperature it gets. So, in the sky, the water vapour cools and changes backinto tiny water droplets. This change is called condensation, and it is the opposite of evaporation.Clouds are made up of tiny water droplets when condensation occurs in the sky clouds form andgrow. When water droplets bump into one another, they stick together and grow in size theycontinue to grow until they are too heavy and fall as rain. They even grow. They bump into oneanother on their journey from the cloud to the ground and every single raindrop that reaches theground is made up of 1 million of the original tiny water droplets.Raindrop fall on the ground surface or the Sun can shine on them and the whole process happensagain. This is called the water cycle and keeps water moving from the ground to the skyproviding the water needed for plants, animals and people to survive.1. What does the water vapour mean?a.

     Then, mary turned to father and asked, "How is rainbow formed?"
     Father began to explain, "sunlight is also known as white light is made up of seven colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. When sunlight passes through a raindrop, it is split into its seven colors and a rainbow is formed. For this to happen, sunlight has to enter throught the front of the air again.
     "How do the colors arrange themselves?" Mary asked.
     "All the colors in sunlight leave or scatter from the raindrops in different directions. That is wnhy we see the colors arranged in a particular order," Father explained.
     "Wow!" Mary exclaimed, "the rainbow is so beautiful and interes ting."</a>

                                            Rainbow
Rainbow is a natural phenomenon that is so impressive. This phenomenon often appears after rain. Rainbow is an arc spectrum which is so large and occurs because the drops are refracted by sunlight. When the sun is shining and the light passing through water droplets, then you will see a refraction that causes a wide variety of colors. Light is refracted like light passing through a glass prism.
Other names of the rainbow is a rainbow which is a symptom of optical and meteorological phenomenon in which light with different colors refracted parallel to each other into water droplets. You can also see this phenomenon under the very high and heavy waterfall.
How does rainbow happen in detail? All the happenings begin when the sunlight passing through the raindrops. Then the light is deflected to the center of the droplet. The white light, now separated from each other into a spectrum of colors. The process does not stop there. The colors that have been separated, then separate again into the very small portions. There is more light separated from each other in the droplets. Then there are more curved and finally those color form a light curve called a rainbow.
Can we make a rainbow? Of course. There are at least two ways that you can do to make a rainbow. First, you can use a spray containing water. We know that rainbows occur when sunlight passing through the raindrops. So, we make our own rain droplets from the water spray. In the morning or afternoon, spray water under the sun, then see the water droplets flying. Spray lots of water and you will see a small rainbow that you can touch easily.
Second, use pieces of video discs then reflected to the light of the sun, and navigate to the wall or ceiling of your house. On the ceiling or the wall, you will see a colorful light that have the same color with the rainbow.
That’s the definition of rainbow, how does it happen, and how we can make it true.

                                            rainbowrainbow is a natural phenomenon in the form of arc spectrum in the sky caused by the refraction of light. rainbow appears after the rains. the colors are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.rainbow is in the form like an arc. however, it actually has a circle shape. the half of the circle can be seen when we see from the higher places such as a mountain or when we are on a plane.the colors are formed as the effect of the refraction and reflection of the sunlight. after raining, the sunlight, which is the white light, touches the raindrops and it is reflected. the light will be separated in different degrees and produces different wavelengths.[30/3 18.54] adel: these wavelength are accepted by our eyes in the form of different colors or spectrum, and we call it as a rainbow. as its position is opposite the sun, we need to turn our backs to the sun to see it.tolong cariin kalimat present simple tense nya dong yang aktif dan pasif​</a>

To the extent that a lot ofpeople create an art work such as song, cake, and many others after seeing the beautiful coloursof rainbow. But, do you know how the phenomenon of the appearance of rainbow happens?Rainbow occurs because of the refraction of light. The sunlight that shines in between theraindrops is refracted by the raindrops. This process separates the white light of the sunlight intoa spectrum of different colours. The spectrum of colours are red, orange, yellow, green, blue,indigo, and violet. Or what we often memorize as the abbreviation "ROY G BIV" (in Indonesia,it is mejikuhibiniu). Then, the colours reflect in the back drops of rain and then resulting the lightwhich looks arched and becomes the rainbow.Task 2Answer the questions based on the text of Task 1 verbally!1. What is the phenomenon told by the text?2. How come does a rainbow occur?3. "...do you know how the phenomenon of the appearance of rainbow happens?"What does the underlined pronoun refer to?4.

                            9. TEXT 2 How Does Rain From and What Is The Water Cycle? Let's look at the size of rain and how raindrops fall first. We'll need the Sun when the Sun shines on water on the Earth's surface, the heat of the Sun warms the water turning it into an invisible gas called water vapour.  This process the changing of water into a gas is called evaporation because gases are lighter than liquids. Water vapor rises up into the sky and the further you move up and away from the Earth's surface the colder temperature gets, so in the sky the water vapor cools and changes back into tiny water droplets. This change is called condensation, and it is the opposite of evaporation. Clouds are made up of tiny water droplets so when condensation occurs in the sky clouds form and grow. When water droplets bump into one another they stick together and grow in size they continue to grow until they are too heavy and fall as rain. They even grows they bump into one another on their journey from the cloud to the ground and every single raindrop that reaches the ground is made up of 1 million of the original tiny water droplets. Raindrops fall on the ground surface or the Sun can shine on them and the whole process happens again. This is called the water cycle and keeps water moving from the ground to the sky providing the water needed for plants animals and people to survive. 6. What does vapour mean? A. Invisible gas of the Sun. B. Very tiny particle of water in the air.C. Gas particle in the air. D. The atmosphere. 7. What makes water turn into vapour? A. The air B. The clouds C. The Sun D. The Earth8. From the first paragraph we can conclude . . . . . A. The size of rain and how raindrops fall. B. The Sun produces the invisible gas. C. The Sun is the main factor of evaporation process. D. Water turns into gas because of Earth's surface. 9. the changing of water into a gas is called evaporation (second paragraph) The underlined word is the antonym of . . . . . A. solidification B. condensation C. desiccation D. Vaporisation 10. Why does water vapor change into water droplets in the sky? A. Because the temperature isn't cold. B. Because the temperature is hot. C. Because the temperature is sizzling. D. Because the temperature is frosty. 11. The process of changing from water vapor into water droplets is . . . . . A. solidification B. condensation C. desiccation D. Evaporation 12. What will happen when condensation occur in the sky?A. Clouds will evaporate. B. Clouds will form and grow. C. Clouds will make tiny water droplets. D. The rain will fall from the sky. 13. According to the text, what is final process before the rain falls? A. Clouds form and grow. B. Water droplets bond one another. C. Clouds bump into one another they stick together. D. Water evaporates to thesky. . . . 14. their journey from the cloud to the ground . . .

Text #4#
Four Men entered a mosque and each busied himself in Sholah, humbly prostrating before Allah. Each one said the “Allahu Akhbar” after first having made his intention, and began to pray with humility. Meanwhile the Mu’adhdhin came in and gave the call to SALAH.
The first man blurted out to the Mu’adhdhin, “Are you calling to the prayer? Are you sure it is the right time?”
The second spoke on the spur of the moment, “You have wasted your SALAH by speaking during prayers!”
The third retorted, “Why did YOU speak? Tell your OWN self how to behave!”
The fourth mumbled, “Praise be to Allah! I wasn’t a party to their arguments.”
Thus all the four broke their Sholah and wasted it. The fault-finders went more astray than the one who made the orginal mistake. Remember! Correct yourself before correcting others.
16. What did the four men do when they entered the mosque?
a. They slept in the mosque
b. They prayed in humanity
c. They spoke one each others
d. They called for SHOLAH (ADZAN)
e. They wanted to meet with the Muadhdhin
17. Why all the four men broke their SHOLAH?
a. They spoke during SHOLAH
b. They slept during SHOLAH
c. They Sholah before taking the holy water (WUDLU)
d. Muadhdhin disturbed them

                            27. How does rain form and what is water cycle?Let's look at the size of rain and how raindrops fall first.We'll need the Sun when the sun shines on water on the Earth's surface. The heat of the Sunwarms the water and turns it into an invisible gas called water vapour.The process when the water changes into gas is called evaporation because gases are lighter thanliquids. Water vapour rises up into the sky and the further it move up and away from the Earth'ssurface, the colder temperature it gets. So, in the sky, the water vapour cools and changes backinto tiny water droplets. This change is called condensation, and it is the opposite of evaporation.Clouds are made up of tiny water droplets when condensation occurs in the sky clouds form andgrow. When water droplets bump into one another, they stick together and grow in size theycontinue to grow until they are too heavy and fall as rain. They even grow. They bump into oneanother on their journey from the cloud to the ground and every single raindrop that reaches theground is made up of 1 million of the original tiny water droplets.Raindrop fall on the ground surface or the Sun can shine on them and the whole process happensagain. This is called the water cycle and keeps water moving from the ground to the skyproviding the water needed for plants, animals and people to survive.1. What does the water vapour mean?a. Invisible gas of the sunb. Very tiny particle of water in the airC. Gas particle in the aird.

     Then, mary turned to father and asked, "How is rainbow formed?"
     Father began to explain, "sunlight is also known as white light is made up of seven colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. When sunlight passes through a raindrop, it is split into its seven colors and a rainbow is formed. For this to happen, sunlight has to enter throught the front of the air again.
     "How do the colors arrange themselves?" Mary asked.
     "All the colors in sunlight leave or scatter from the raindrops in different directions. That is wnhy we see the colors arranged in a particular order," Father explained.

                            32. Rainbow
Rainbow is a natural phenomenon that is so impressive. This phenomenon often appears after rain. Rainbow is an arc spectrum which is so large and occurs because the drops are refracted by sunlight. When the sun is shining and the light passing through water droplets, then you will see a refraction that causes a wide variety of colors. Light is refracted like light passing through a glass prism.
Other names of the rainbow is a rainbow which is a symptom of optical and meteorological phenomenon in which light with different colors refracted parallel to each other into water droplets. You can also see this phenomenon under the very high and heavy waterfall.
How does rainbow happen in detail? All the happenings begin when the sunlight passing through the raindrops. Then the light is deflected to the center of the droplet. The white light, now separated from each other into a spectrum of colors. The process does not stop there. The colors that have been separated, then separate again into the very small portions. There is more light separated from each other in the droplets. Then there are more curved and finally those color form a light curve called a rainbow.
Can we make a rainbow? Of course. There are at least two ways that you can do to make a rainbow. First, you can use a spray containing water. We know that rainbows occur when sunlight passing through the raindrops. So, we make our own rain droplets from the water spray. In the morning or afternoon, spray water under the sun, then see the water droplets flying. Spray lots of water and you will see a small rainbow that you can touch easily.
Second, use pieces of video discs then reflected to the light of the sun, and navigate to the wall or ceiling of your house. On the ceiling or the wall, you will see a colorful light that have the same color with the rainbow.
That’s the definition of rainbow, how does it happen, and how we can make it true.
