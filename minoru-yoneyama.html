The Proclamation of Indonesian Independence
The proclamation of Indonesian independence was read at 10.00 a.m. on Friday, 17 August 1945. The declaration marked the start of the diplomatic and armed resistance of the Indonesian National Revolution, fighting against the forces of the Netherlands and pro-Dutch civilians, until the latter officially acknowledged Indonesia's independence in 1949. In 2005, the Netherlands declared that they had decided to accept de facto17 August 1945 as Indonesia's independence date. In a 2013 interview the Indonesian historian Sukotjo, amongst others, asked the Dutch government to formally acknowledge the date of independence as 17 August 1945. The United Nations, who mediated in the conflict, formally acknowledge the date of independence as 27 December 1949.
The document was signed by Sukarno (who signed his name "Soekarno" using the older Dutch orthography) and Mohammad Hatta, who were appointed president and vice-president respectively the following day.
The draft was prepared only a few hours earlier, on the night of 16 August, by Sukarno, Hatta, and Soebardjo, at Rear-Admiral Maeda (Minoru) Tadashi's house, Miyako-Doori 1, Jakarta (now the "Museum of the Declaration of Independence", JL. Imam Bonjol I, Jakarta). The original Indonesian Declaration of Independence was typed by Sayuti Melik. Maeda himself was sleeping in his room upstairs. He was agreeable to the idea of Indonesia'sindependence, and had lent his house for the drafting of the declaration. Marshal Terauchi, the highest-ranking Japanese leader in South East Asia and son of Prime Minister Terauchi Masatake, was however against Indonesia's independence, scheduled for 24 August.
While the formal preparation of the declaration, and the official independence itself for that matter, had been carefully planned a few months earlier, the actual declaration date was brought forward almost inadvertently as a consequence of the Japanese unconditional surrender to the Allies on 15 August following the Nagasaki atomic bombing. The historic event was triggered by a plot, led by a few more radical youth activists such asAdam Malik and Chairul Saleh, that put pressure on Sukarno and Hatta to proclaim independence immediately. The declaration was to be signed by the 27 members of the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence (PPKI) symbolically representing the new nation's diversity. The particular act was apparently inspired by a similar spirit of the United States Declaration of Independence. However, the idea was heavily turned down by the radical activists mentioned earlier, arguing that the committee was too closely associated with then soon to be defunct Japanese occupation rule, thus creating a potential credibility issue. Instead, the radical activists demanded that the signatures of six of them were to be put on the document. All parties involved in the historical moment finally agreed on a compromise solution which only included Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta as the co-signers in the name of the nation of Indonesia.
Sukarno had initially wanted the declaration to be read at Ikada Plain, the large open field in the centre of Jakarta, but due to unfounded widespread apprehension over the possibility of Japanese sabotage, the venuewas changed to Sukarno's house at Pegangsaan Timur 56. There was no concrete evidence for the growing suspicions, as the Japanese had already surrendered to the Allies, The declaration of independence passed without a hitch.
The proclamation at 56, Jalan Pegangsaan Timur, Jakarta, was heard throughout the country because the text was secretly broadcast by Indonesian radio personnel using the transmitters of the JAKARTA Hoso Kyoku radio station. An English translation of the proclamation was broadcast overseas.</a>

                                            The Proclamation of Indonesian IndependenceThe proclamation of Indonesian independence was read at 10.00 a.m. on Friday, 17 August 1945. The declaration marked the start of the diplomatic and armed resistance of the Indonesian National Revolution, fighting against the forces of the Netherlands and pro- Dutch civilians, until the latter officially acknowledged Indonesia's independence in 1949. In 2005, the Netherlands declared that they had decided to accept de facto 17 August 1945 as Indonesia's independence date. In a 2013 interview the Indonesian historian Sukotjo, amongst others, asked the Dutch government to formally acknowledge the date of independence as 17 August 1945. The United Nations, who mediated in the conflict, formally acknowledge the date of independence as 27 December 1949.The document was signed by Sukarno (who signed his name "Soekarno" using the older Dutch orthography) and Mohammad Hatta, who were appointed president and vice- president respectively the following day.The draft was prepared only a few hours earlier, on the night of 16 August, by Sukarno, Hatta, and Soebardjo, at Rear-Admiral Maeda (Minoru) Tadashi's house, Miyako-Doori 1, Jakarta (now the "Museum of the Declaration of Independence", JL. Imam Bonjol I, Jakarta). The original Indonesian Declaration of Independence was typed by Sayuti Melik. Maeda himself was sleeping in his room upstairs. He was agreeable to the idea of Indonesia's independence, and had lent his house for the drafting of the declaration. Marshal Terauchi, the highest-ranking Japanese leader in South East Asia and son of Prime Minister Terauchi Masatake, was however against Indonesia's independence, scheduled for 24 August.While the formal preparation of the declaration, and the official independence itself for that matter, had been carefully planned a few months earlier, the actual declaration date was brought forward almost inadvertently as a consequence of the Japanese unconditional surrender to the Allies on 15 August following the Nagasaki atomic bombing. The historic event was triggered by a plot, led by a few more radical youth activists such as Adam Malik and Chairul Saleh, that’s put pressure on Sukarno and Hatta to proclaim independence  immediately. The declaration was to be signed by the 27 members of the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence (PPKI) symbolically representing the new nation's diversity. The particular act was apparently inspired by a similar spirit of the United States Declaration of Independence. However, the idea was heavily turned down by the radical activists mentioned earlier, arguing that the committee was too closely associated with then soon to be defunct Japanese occupation rule, thus creating a potential credibility issue. Instead, the radical activists demanded that the signatures of six of them were to be put on the document. All parties involved in the historical moment finally agreed on a compromise solution which only included Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta as the co- signers in the name of the nation of Indonesia.Sukarno had initially wanted the declaration to be read at Ikada Plain, the large open field in the centre of Jakarta, but due to unfounded widespread apprehension over the possibility of Japanese sabotage, the venue was changed to Sukarno's house at Pegangsaan Timur 56. There was no concrete evidence for the growing suspicions, as the Japanese had already surrendered to the Allies, the declaration of independence passed without a hitch.The proclamation at 56, Jalan Pegangsaan Timur, Jakarta, was heard throughout the country because the text was secretly broadcast by Indonesian radio personnel using the transmitters of the JAKARTA Hoso Kyoku radio station.

Instead, the radical activists demanded that the signatures of six of them were to be put on the document. All parties involved in the historical moment finally agreed on a compromise solution which only included Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta as the co-signers 'in the name of the nation of Indonesia'.Sukarno had initially wanted the declaration to be read at Ikada Plain, the large open field in the centre of Jakarta, but due to unfounded widespread apprehension over the possibility of Japanese sabotage, the venue was changed to Sukarno's house at Pegangsaan Timur 56. There was no concrete evidence for the growing suspicions, as the Japanese had already surrendered to the Allies, The declaration of independence passed without a hitch. The proclamation at 56, Jalan Pegangsaan Timur, Jakarta, was heard throughout the country because the text was secretly broadcast by Indonesian radio personnel using the transmitters of the JAKARTA Hoso Kyoku radio station.

                                            Proklamasi kemerdekaan Indonesia dibacakan pada pukul 10.00 pagi pada hari Jumat tanggal 17 Agustus 1945. Deklarasi tersebut menandai dimulainya perlawanan diplomatik dan bersenjata Revolusi Nasional Indonesia, melawan kekuatan Belanda dan sipil pro Belanda, hingga akhirnya resmi secara resmi. mengakui kemerdekaan Indonesia pada tahun 1949. Pada tahun 2005, UUBelanda menyatakan bahwa mereka telah memutuskan untuk menerima secara de facto 17 Agustus 1945 sebagai tanggal kemerdekaan Indonesia. Dalam wawancara tahun 2013, sejarawan Indonesia Sukotjo, antara lain, meminta pemerintah Belanda untuk secara resmi mengakui tanggal kemerdekaan adalah 17 Agustus 1945. Perserikatan Bangsa-Bangsa, yang menjadi penengah konflik, secara resmi mengakui tanggal kemerdekaan adalah 27 Desember 1949.Dokumen tersebut ditandatangani oleh Sukarno (yang menandatangani namanya "Soekarno" menggunakan ortografi Belanda yang lebih tua) dan Mohammad Hatta, yang masing-masing diangkat sebagai presiden dan wakil presiden pada hari berikutnya. Rancangan itu baru disiapkan beberapa jam sebelumnya, pada malam 16 Agustus, oleh Sukarno, Hatta, dan Soebardjo, di rumah Laksamana Muda Maeda (Minoru) Tadashi, Miyako-Doori 1, Jakarta (sekarang "Museum Deklarasi Kemerdekaan ", JL. Imam Bonjol I, Jakarta). Proklamasi Kemerdekaan Indonesia asli diketik oleh Sayuti Melik. Maeda sendiri sedang tidur di kamarnya di lantai atas. Dia setuju dengan gagasan kemerdekaan Indonesia, dan telah meminjamkan rumahnya untuk penyusunan deklarasi tersebut. Marsekal Terauchi, pemimpin tertinggi Jepang di Asia Tenggara dan putra Perdana Menteri Terauchi Masatake, menentang kemerdekaan Indonesia, yang dijadwalkan pada 24 Agustus.Sementara persiapan formal deklarasi, dan dalam hal ini kemerdekaan resmi itu sendiri, telah direncanakan dengan hati-hati beberapa bulan sebelumnya, tanggal deklarasi yang sebenarnya dimajukan hampir secara tidak sengaja sebagai konsekuensi dari penyerahan tanpa syarat Jepang kepada Sekutu pada 15 Agustus setelahnya. pemboman atom Nagasaki. Peristiwa bersejarah itu dipicu oleh sebuah plot yang dipimpin oleh beberapa aktivis pemuda radikal seperti Adam Malik dan Chairul Saleh, yang menekan Soekarno dan Hatta untuk segera memproklamasikan kemerdekaan. Deklarasi yang akan ditandatangani oleh 27 anggota Panitia Persiapan Kemerdekaan Indonesia (PPKI) tersebut secara simbolis mewakili kebhinekaan bangsa baru. Tindakan tertentu tampaknya diilhami oleh semangat yang sama dari Deklarasi Kemerdekaan Amerika Serikat. Namun, gagasan tersebut ditolak keras oleh para aktivis radikal yang disebutkan sebelumnya, dengan alasan bahwa komite tersebut terlalu erat terkait dengan pemerintahan pendudukan Jepang yang kemudian akan segera ditutup, sehingga menciptakan masalah kredibilitas potensial. Sebaliknya, para aktivis radikal menuntut agar enam di antaranya dicantumkan dalam dokumen tersebut. Semua pihak yang terlibat dalam momen sejarah akhirnya menyepakati solusi kompromi yang hanya melibatkan Soekarno dan Mohammad Hatta sebagai rekan penandatangan atas nama bangsa Indonesia.Sukarno semula ingin deklarasi dibacakan di Dataran Ikada, lapangan terbuka yang luas di pusat Jakarta, namun karena kekhawatiran yang tidak berdasar atas kemungkinan sabotase Jepang, tempat tersebut diubah menjadi rumah Sukarno di Pegangsaan Timur 56. Ada tidak ada bukti konkret untuk kecurigaan yang berkembang, karena Jepang sudah menyerah kepada Sekutu, deklarasi kemerdekaan berlalu tanpa hambatan. Proklamasi di 56, Jalan Pegangsaan Timur, Jakarta, terdengar di seluruh negeri karena teks itu disiarkan secara diam-diam oleh personel radio Indonesia menggunakanpemancar stasiun radio JAKARTA Hoso Kyoku.

The Proclamation of Indonesian Independence
The proclamation of Indonesian independence was read at 10.00 a.m. on Friday, 17 August 1945. The declaration marked the start of the diplomatic and armed resistance of the Indonesian National Revolution, fighting against the forces of the Netherlands and pro-Dutch civilians, until the latter officially acknowledged Indonesia's independence in 1949. In 2005, the Netherlands declared that they had decided to accept de facto17 August 1945 as Indonesia's independence date. In a 2013 interview the Indonesian historian Sukotjo, amongst others, asked the Dutch government to formally acknowledge the date of independence as 17 August 1945. The United Nations, who mediated in the conflict, formally acknowledge the date of independence as 27 December 1949.
The document was signed by Sukarno (who signed his name "Soekarno" using the older Dutch orthography) and Mohammad Hatta, who were appointed president and vice-president respectively the following day.
The draft was prepared only a few hours earlier, on the night of 16 August, by Sukarno, Hatta, and Soebardjo, at Rear-Admiral Maeda (Minoru) Tadashi's house, Miyako-Doori 1, Jakarta (now the "Museum of the Declaration of Independence", JL. Imam Bonjol I, Jakarta). The original Indonesian Declaration of Independence was typed by Sayuti Melik. Maeda himself was sleeping in his room upstairs. He was agreeable to the idea of Indonesia'sindependence, and had lent his house for the drafting of the declaration. Marshal Terauchi, the highest-ranking Japanese leader in South East Asia and son of Prime Minister Terauchi Masatake, was however against Indonesia's independence, scheduled for 24 August.
While the formal preparation of the declaration, and the official independence itself for that matter, had been carefully planned a few months earlier, the actual declaration date was brought forward almost inadvertently as a consequence of the Japanese unconditional surrender to the Allies on 15 August following the Nagasaki atomic bombing. The historic event was triggered by a plot, led by a few more radical youth activists such asAdam Malik and Chairul Saleh, that put pressure on Sukarno and Hatta to proclaim independence immediately.

Instead, the radical activists demanded that the signatures of six of them were to be put on the document. All parties involved in the historical moment finally agreed on a compromise solution which only included Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta as the co-signers in the name of the nation of Indonesia.

There was no concrete evidence for the growing suspicions, as the Japanese had already surrendered to the Allies, The declaration of independence passed without a hitch.

The Proclamation of Indonesian IndependenceThe proclamation of Indonesian independence marked the start of the diplomatic and armed resistance of the Indonesian National Revolution, and fight against the forces of the Netherlands and pro-Dutch civilians until Indonesia's independence officially acknowledged in 1949.Firstly, the formal preparation of the declaration, and the official independence had been carefully planned a few months earlier. The actual declaration date was delayed as a consequence of the Japanese unconditional surrender to the Allies on 15 August following the Nagasaki atomic bombing. The historical event was triggered by a plot, led by a few more radical youth activists, such as Adam Malik and Chairul Saleh, that put pressure on Sukarno and Hatta to proclaim independence immediately. The declaration was to be signed by the 27 members of the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence (PPKI) symbolically representing the new nation's diversity.After that declaration signed by the 27 members was apparently inspired by a similar spirit of the United States Declaration of Independence. Besides, some radical activists demanded that their signatures were included on the document. All parties involved in the historical moment finally agreed on a compromise solution which only included Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta as the co- signers in the name of the nation of Indonesia.Only a few hours earlier on the night of 16 August, the draft was prepared by Sukarno, Hatta, and Soebardjo, at Rear-Admiral Maeda (Minoru) Tadashi's house, Miyako-Doori 1, Jakarta (now the "Museum of the Declaration of Independence", Jl. Imam Bonjol 1, Jakarta). The original Indonesian Declaration of Independence was typed by Sayuti Melik. Maeda himself was sleeping in his room upstairs. He was agree to the idea of Indonesia's independence, and had lent his house for the drafting of the declaration.Then the declaration was read at 10.00 a.m. on Friday, 17 August 1945. The document finally was signed by Sukarno (who signed his name "Soekarno" using the older Dutch orthography) and Mohammad Hatta, who were appointed as the president and vice-president at the following day.Sukarno had initially wanted the declaration to be read at Ikada Plain, the large open field in the center of Jakarta, but due to unfounded widespread issues over the possibility of Japanese sabotage, the venue was changed to Sukarno's house at Pegangsaan Timur 56.Finally, Indonesia declared the proclamation and it was heard throughout the country because the text was secretly broadcast by Indonesian radio personnel using the transmitters of the JAKARTA Hoso Kyoku radio station.

Proklamasi Kemerdekaan Indonesia Proklamasi kemerdekaan Indonesia dibacakan pada pukul 10.00 WIB pada hari Jumat, 17 Agustus 1945. Deklarasi tersebut menandai dimulainya perlawanan diplomatik dan bersenjata Revolusi Nasional Indonesia melawan pasukan Belanda dan warga sipil pro Belanda, sampai yang terakhir secara resmi mengakui kemerdekaan Indonesia pada tahun 1949. Pada tahun 2005, Belanda menyatakan bahwa mereka telah memutuskan untuk menerima de facto 17 Agustus 1945 sebagai tanggal kemerdekaan Indonesia. Dalam sebuah wawancara tahun 2013, sejarawan Indonesia Sukotio, antara lain, meminta pemerintah Belanda untuk secara resmi mengakui tanggal kemerdekaan sebagai 17 Agustus 1945. Perserikatan Bangsa-Bangsa, yang menengahi konflik, secara resmi mengakui tanggal kemerdekaan sebagai 27 Desember 1949. dokumen ditandatangani oleh Sukarno (yang menandatangani namanya "Soekamo" menggunakan ortografi Belanda yang lebih tua) dan Mohammad Hatta, yang diangkat sebagai presiden dan wakil presiden masing-masing pada hari berikutnya. Draf itu disiapkan hanya beberapa jam sebelumnya, pada malam 16 Agustus, oleh Sukarno Hatta, dan Soebardjo, di rumah Laksamana Muda Maeda (Minoru) Tadashi, Muvake. Doori 1, Jakarta (sekarang "Museum Proklamasi", JL. Imam Bonjoll, Jakarta). Proklamasi Kemerdekaan Indonesia yang asli diketik oleh Sayuti Melik Maeda sendiri sedang tidur di kamarnya di lantai atas. Dia setuju dengan gagasan kemerdekaan Indonesia, dan telah meminjamkan rumahnya untuk penyusunan deklarasi Marsekal Terauchi, pemimpin tertinggi Jepang di Asia Tenggara dan putra Perdana Menteri Terauchi Masatake, namun menentang kemerdekaan Indonesia, dijadwalkan untuk 24 Agustus. Sementara persiapan formal deklarasi, dan kemerdekaan resmi itu sendiri dalam hal ini, telah direncanakan dengan cermat beberapa bulan sebelumnya, tanggal deklarasi sebenarnya dimajukan hampir secara tidak sengaja sebagai konsekuensi dari penyerahan tanpa syarat Jepang kepada Sekutu pada 15 Agustus setelahnya. bom atom Nagasaki. Peristiwa bersejarah itu dipicu oleh sebuah komplotan yang dipimpin oleh beberapa aktivis pemuda radikal seperti Adam Malik dan Chairul Saleh, yang menekan Sukamo dan Hatta untuk segera memproklamasikan kemerdekaan. Deklarasi tersebut akan ditandatangani oleh 27 anggota Panitia Persiapan Kemerdekaan Indonesia (PPKI) yang secara simbolis mewakili kebhinekaan bangsa baru. Tindakan khusus itu tampaknya diilhami oleh semangat yang sama dari Deklarasi Kemerdekaan Amerika Serikat. Namun, gagasan itu ditolak mentah-mentah oleh para aktivis radikal yang disebutkan sebelumnya, dengan alasan bahwa komite tersebut terlalu terkait erat dengan pemerintahan pendudukan Jepang yang akan segera berakhir, sehingga menimbulkan potensi masalah kredibilitas. Sebaliknya, para aktivis radikal menuntut agar enam orang di antara mereka membubuhkan tanda tangan pada dokumen tersebut. Semua pihak yang terlibat dalam momen bersejarah akhirnya menyepakati solusi kompromi yang hanya memasukkan Sukamo dan Mohammad Hatta sebagai penandatangan atas nama bangsa Indonesia Sukamo awalnya ingin deklarasi dibacakan di Dataran Ikada, lapangan terbuka yang luas di pusat Jakarta, tetapi karena kekhawatiran luas yang tidak berdasar atas kemungkinan sabotase Jepang, tempat itu diubah menjadi rumah Sukarno di Pegangsaan Timur 56. Tidak ada bukti nyata untuk kecurigaan yang berkembang, karena Jepang sudah menyerah kepada Sekutu, proklamasi kemerdekaan berlalu tanpa hambatan Proklamasi di 56, Jalan Pegangsaan Timur Jakarta, terdengar di seluruh negeri karena teksnya disiarkan secara rahasia oleh personel radio Indonesia menggunakan pemancar stasiun radio JAKARTA Hose Kyoku Terjemahan bahasa Inggris dari proklamasi disiarkan luar negeri</p><p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p><p>semoga membantu </p><p></p><br />

                            19. Proklamasi kemerdekaan Indonesia dibacakan pada pukul 10.00 pagi pada hari Jumat tanggal 17 Agustus 1945. Deklarasi tersebut menandai dimulainya perlawanan diplomatik dan bersenjata Revolusi Nasional Indonesia, melawan kekuatan Belanda dan sipil pro Belanda, hingga akhirnya resmi secara resmi. mengakui kemerdekaan Indonesia pada tahun 1949. Pada tahun 2005, UUBelanda menyatakan bahwa mereka telah memutuskan untuk menerima secara de facto 17 Agustus 1945 sebagai tanggal kemerdekaan Indonesia. Dalam wawancara tahun 2013, sejarawan Indonesia Sukotjo, antara lain, meminta pemerintah Belanda untuk secara resmi mengakui tanggal kemerdekaan adalah 17 Agustus 1945. Perserikatan Bangsa-Bangsa, yang menjadi penengah konflik, secara resmi mengakui tanggal kemerdekaan adalah 27 Desember 1949.Dokumen tersebut ditandatangani oleh Sukarno (yang menandatangani namanya "Soekarno" menggunakan ortografi Belanda yang lebih tua) dan Mohammad Hatta, yang masing-masing diangkat sebagai presiden dan wakil presiden pada hari berikutnya. Rancangan itu baru disiapkan beberapa jam sebelumnya, pada malam 16 Agustus, oleh Sukarno, Hatta, dan Soebardjo, di rumah Laksamana Muda Maeda (Minoru) Tadashi, Miyako-Doori 1, Jakarta (sekarang "Museum Deklarasi Kemerdekaan ", JL. Imam Bonjol I, Jakarta). Proklamasi Kemerdekaan Indonesia asli diketik oleh Sayuti Melik. Maeda sendiri sedang tidur di kamarnya di lantai atas. Dia setuju dengan gagasan kemerdekaan Indonesia, dan telah meminjamkan rumahnya untuk penyusunan deklarasi tersebut. Marsekal Terauchi, pemimpin tertinggi Jepang di Asia Tenggara dan putra Perdana Menteri Terauchi Masatake, menentang kemerdekaan Indonesia, yang dijadwalkan pada 24 Agustus.Sementara persiapan formal deklarasi, dan dalam hal ini kemerdekaan resmi itu sendiri, telah direncanakan dengan hati-hati beberapa bulan sebelumnya, tanggal deklarasi yang sebenarnya dimajukan hampir secara tidak sengaja sebagai konsekuensi dari penyerahan tanpa syarat Jepang kepada Sekutu pada 15 Agustus setelahnya. pemboman atom Nagasaki. Peristiwa bersejarah itu dipicu oleh sebuah plot yang dipimpin oleh beberapa aktivis pemuda radikal seperti Adam Malik dan Chairul Saleh, yang menekan Soekarno dan Hatta untuk segera memproklamasikan kemerdekaan. Deklarasi yang akan ditandatangani oleh 27 anggota Panitia Persiapan Kemerdekaan Indonesia (PPKI) tersebut secara simbolis mewakili kebhinekaan bangsa baru. Tindakan tertentu tampaknya diilhami oleh semangat yang sama dari Deklarasi Kemerdekaan Amerika Serikat. Namun, gagasan tersebut ditolak keras oleh para aktivis radikal yang disebutkan sebelumnya, dengan alasan bahwa komite tersebut terlalu erat terkait dengan pemerintahan pendudukan Jepang yang kemudian akan segera ditutup, sehingga menciptakan masalah kredibilitas potensial. Sebaliknya, para aktivis radikal menuntut agar enam di antaranya dicantumkan dalam dokumen tersebut. Semua pihak yang terlibat dalam momen sejarah akhirnya menyepakati solusi kompromi yang hanya melibatkan Soekarno dan Mohammad Hatta sebagai rekan penandatangan atas nama bangsa Indonesia.Sukarno semula ingin deklarasi dibacakan di Dataran Ikada, lapangan terbuka yang luas di pusat Jakarta, namun karena kekhawatiran yang tidak berdasar atas kemungkinan sabotase Jepang, tempat tersebut diubah menjadi rumah Sukarno di Pegangsaan Timur 56. Ada tidak ada bukti konkret untuk kecurigaan yang berkembang, karena Jepang sudah menyerah kepada Sekutu, deklarasi kemerdekaan berlalu tanpa hambatan. Proklamasi di 56, Jalan Pegangsaan Timur, Jakarta, terdengar di seluruh negeri karena teks itu disiarkan secara diam-diam oleh personel radio Indonesia menggunakanpemancar stasiun radio JAKARTA Hoso Kyoku.
